  Title: No end to my troubles.
  Subtitle: Kento
  Content: "\tI\u2019m happy to report that Rose has formally refused to work on
    the game as opposed to pretending to work while dragging her feet. It\u2019s
    always better to know for sure that you can\u2019t depend on someone than to
    wonder if you can.\r\n\r\n\tIt drives me crazy how she so clearly does not give
    a shit about the game, how she treats every task relating to it like it's an
    ordeal, and yet also feels the need to micromanage it while telling me I\u2019M
    the one doing the micromanaging. The other day she was complaining that it feels
    more like \u201Cmy game\u201D instead of \u201Cour game\u201D, which is ridiculous
    considering how hands off she\u2019s been. She\u2019s not invested in it artistically
    at all, she just wants to mark it as \u2018hers.\u2019 She didn\u2019t do a single
    word of <mark=#ffff00aa>writing</mark> for the story either - she doesn\u2019t
    have a grasp on its themes, which is what really matters. I\u2019m ignoring her
    whining.\r\n\r\n\tEren also seems checked out. I think they\u2019re just exhausted
    since I know they\u2019ve been having <mark=#ffff00aa>health</mark> issues with
    bright lights. I\u2019m tired too, so I get it. \r\n\r\n\tIn the meantime I\u2019m
    gonna try and implement Ritual myself. The code is going to be mangled because
    I need to work around that bizarre bug. Eren is wary of changing anything about
    the game\u2019s inner workings too much while it\u2019s still glitched. But I
    don\u2019t want to lose momentum; we can fix the code later. \r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s
    very easy to lose your motivation to finish a game if you walk away from it for
    too long, and on some level I suspect Eren is looking for a way to \u2018off-board.\u2019
    They went so far as to suggest we send the entirety of our source code to the
    Toonity development staff and hope that they\u2019ll decide to fix our stupid
    <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark> for us free of charge. As if a mega-corporation
    would even read an email a pair of nobodies sent their way, let alone comb through
    thousands of lines of code.\r\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t understand Eren\u2019s instinct
    to defer to authority when they\u2019re in trouble. If I give into this we\u2019ll
    be sitting on our hands indefinitely while we wait for a fix. The game just won\u2019t
    get released.\r\n\r\n\tThis defeatism will hurt both of our careers. I don\u2019t
    want to enable it.\r"
