  Title: Mic check and managing Kento
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- Testing testing one two three. Four five six seven eight nine. Ok great
    because if I had to go back to Guitar World to return this thing again I would
    like die\r\n- So dev log! I ended up working with Kento on that thing we\u2019ve
    been messing around with for a few months\r\n- We used to just call it \u201Cour
    game\u201D but now it has a name. It\u2019s called Trasmus. Trasmus? <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>\r\n-
    I\u2019m gonna have to manually correct that one each time huh\r\n- Kento\u2019s
    cool and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s letting me work on his baby. He has a very particular
    way he likes to get things done that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say\r\n- Oh and we
    brought on Rose, too. For the art\r\n- So far we have a small test level where
    you can move around a very simple <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark>\r\n- Well it\u2019s
    barely a <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> but it\u2019ll be one soon\r\n- There\u2019s
    also the very beginnings of the spell system that Rose suggested\r\n- Kento wanted
    to put comments directly into the game build so that\u2019s in there too\r\n-
    I had to use that feature basically right away too since Kento decided to drop
    a random wall right in the middle of the level last night. Lol\r\n- I\u2019m
    a little bit worried about Kento working with Rose since it was a big step for
    him to let me work on \u201Chis vision\u201D or whatever he\u2019s got going
    on in the first place\r\n- And I just worry that he\u2019s not gonna react too
    well to Rose taking initiative on the project. Creative differences and all that\r\n-
    Eh one step at a time I guess\r\n- My dad says that that\u2019s kind of what
    these really artsy people need though. And I can see where he\u2019s coming from\r\n-
    If we just let Kento run wild and free <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark> would
    get finished in twenty twenty never\r\n- I\u2019m hopeful that with Rose\u2019s
    previous game dev experience and Kento\u2019s, uh, unique way of looking at things,
    we can make something great in just a year\r\n- Even something that aligns with
    Kento\u2019s grand vision because he\u2019s a lot more creative than me and I
    really just want to work on cool stuff and bring that vision to life\r\n\r\n"
