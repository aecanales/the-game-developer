  Title: fights, bosses.
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "I\u2019m working with maybe\u2026 6 hours of sleep over 48 hours as I
    write this. I will concede that Rose had a point about all nighters.\n\r\nBut
    we soldier on! Time waits for no one and I have plans. Many plans. Once I\u2019ve
    slept I\u2019m diving straight in: I\u2019m refining the design documents, finalizing
    the spells for our modular magic system, and finishing those new enemies. Rose
    can\u2019t start the 3D models until she knows what sort of abilities they\u2019ll
    have.\n\r\nI\u2019m also going to further detail the story outline. A third sage
    is being introduced, related to the events that saw our protagonist imprisoned.
    More on that in the story document. It won\u2019t fit here. Concerning their
    integration with gameplay, the Frontier section will lead the player to an arena.
    Each sage has a separate \u2018boss rush\u2019 gauntlet, the third being locked
    until the first two fall. It\u2019s better for pacing if the secrets they hold
    aren\u2019t revealed too early. The \u2018plot\u2019 reason for this is\u2026
    that the third sage has been locked away in a manner much like our protagonist,
    and for just as long. I think that will work, but I might revisit the question
    later.\n\r\nIf I recruit Eren to assist me with some of the simpler tasks over
    the Winter Break, this ought to be doable. Rose is insistent about not overworking
    herself, so I can\u2019t depend on her help during the off-season.\r\n"
