      Data: The great giant, whose eyes are the three suns of Nyxos (the planet on
        which the game takes place). His third eye is called Kaos, and governs all
        forces of discord; desire, insurrection, and magic. A thousand years before
        the story began, the Paladins of the White Sea blinded the eye of Kaos in
        an effort to defeat Dirac, defeating the dark lord at the cost of wounding
        Soltrice - and the world - in turn. There can be no magic without chaos.

      Data: I don't think the professor will be thrilled to have their feedback immortalized
        by Kento's little joke NPC. Inside jokes are fine, but did that little jab
        have to go into the PUBLIC facing build? I respect Kento's talent, but sometimes
        I question his maturity.

      Data: 'I''ve temporarily relented on my intent to have there be no spoken dialogue,
        and have the story communicated entirely through gesture and hieroglyphs.
        Eren and I tested a simple dialogue system with this "Old Man" character.
        Moving onto the <b>Maze</b> build, I decided I wanted the player to start
        inside it. We''ll later learn this is the place they were imprisoned, which
        begs the question: WHY were they imprisoned?'
