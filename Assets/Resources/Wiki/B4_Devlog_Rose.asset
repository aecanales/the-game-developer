  Title: winter break more like breaking my fucking sanity
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- why the fuck did kento get mad at me for taking a break during break???\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i saw updates to the kithub pretty much every week and once again kento is just
    throwing work at me without discussing or even telling me about it\r\n- and then
    he got mad at me when i brought it up. like dude if we don\u2019t communicate
    this project is going to fall apart </indent>\r\n- speaking of break, i wanted
    to try out a new 3D modeling technique that i didn\u2019t get the chance to during
    the semester\r\n<indent=5%>- mostly bc i didn\u2019t want to break eren\u2019s
    systems but i also wasn\u2019t sure that it could apply to <mark=#ffff00aa>trismegistus</mark>
    specifically \r\n- i revived <mark=#ffff00aa>the last knight</mark> to try it
    out on and it turned out super well so i ended up putting it on my itch page
    \r\n- but now i know that the technique doesn\u2019t require us to redo all our
    implementation stuff so i can start using it going forward! </indent>\r\n- work
    updates: \r\n<indent=5%>- <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> is 95% done. i\u2019m not
    touching that for now unless it explodes\r\n- my initial plan last month was
    to do all the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier assets</mark> and then tackle the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    stuff but kento is really pushing for me to do the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    ones so he can test his <mark=#ffff00aa>puzzles</mark>\r\n- i guess i can have
    a few of them do double duty but it\u2019ll be tough\r\n- <mark=#ffff00aa>modular
    magic</mark> system still needs final icons but kento said he\u2019s still working
    out a few things. no eta on that</indent>\r\n- we\u2019re planning to submit
    for <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark> this year! \r\n<indent=5%>- i\u2019m really worried
    about the amount of polish we\u2019re gonna get on <mark=#ffff00aa>trismegistus</mark>
    before then. it needs to be presentable enough for industry professionals not
    to write it off but kento seems insistent on spreading us thin so he can go play
    in the sandbox he\u2019s asking us to make for him\r\n- i really don\u2019t want
    this to reflect badly on all of us (especially eren, who\u2019s being run absolutely
    ragged) \r\n- i hope we\u2019ll be ready in time\u2026 </indent>\r"
