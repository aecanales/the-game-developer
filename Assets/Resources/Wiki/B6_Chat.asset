    on the floor: It was really nice to meet your families too \r\nKento\u2019s Still
    Writing: I wouldn\u2019t exactly describe meeting my parents as a \u201Cnice\u201D
    experience, but I\u2019m going to keep my focus on how many people got sucked
    into the narrative of my game. \r\npunished rose: yeah that never gets old tbh\r\npunished
    rose: especially when people notice the small details\r\npunished rose: was really
    annoying when that lady was constantly making her teenage son the center of attention
    though\r\npunished rose: not just at our setup but literally fucking everywhere
    else\r\nKento\u2019s Still Writing: Oh, right, you were wandering the showcase
    floor when she showed her face. \r\nKento\u2019s Still Writing: I have the great
    misfortune of having that woman as my mother. \r\npunished rose: oh\r\npunished
    rose: Yikes\r\npunished rose: yeah that checks out\r\npunished rose: her son

    on the floor: It was nice chatting with your dad for a bit though Kento\r\nLai-ing
    on the floor: He seemed really interested in the narrative \r\nKento\u2019s Still
    Writing: He finally remembered to be interested in something I\u2019m passionate
    about that isn\u2019t tied to my brother in some way, more like. \r\nKento\u2019s
    Still Writing: It was probably just a means to an end for him. \r\npunished rose:

    trying to make up for things that he knows can never be fixed\r\nKento\u2019s

    honest. \r\npunished rose: whats that supposed to mean \r\nLai-ing on the floor:
