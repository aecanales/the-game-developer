  Title: Fights, bosses.

  Content: "\tI\u2019m working with maybe\u2026 6 hours of sleep over 48 hours as
    I write this. I will concede that Rose had a point about all nighters.\r\n\n\tBut
    we soldier on! Time waits for no one, even though I\u2019ve finished the practical
    portions of the <mark=#ffff00aa>Euphrosyne</mark> build, and I have plans. Many
    plans. Once I\u2019ve slept I\u2019m diving straight in: I\u2019m refining the
    story and game design documents for our final submission, finalizing the spells
    for our <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark> magic system, and finishing those new
    enemies. Rose can\u2019t start making the 3D models until she knows what sort
    of abilities they\u2019ll have.\n\r\n\tI\u2019m also going to further detail
    the work I\u2019ve done on the story outline. I\u2019ve decided to call what
    would normally be referred to as a god of the world a \u201C<mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark>\u201D
    instead, and a third <mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark> is being introduced, related
    to the events that saw our protagonist imprisoned. More on that in the story
    document. It won\u2019t fit here. \n\r\n\tConcerning their integration with gameplay,
    I\u2019ve also done some long-term planning. Once the <mark=#ffff00aa>sorcerer</mark>
    manages to escape the first level, the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> level
    slated for next semester will lead the player to their domains located high in
    the mountains of the former kingdom. Each sage has a separate \u2018boss rush\u2019
    gauntlet, the third being locked until the first two fall. It\u2019s better for
    pacing if the secrets they hold aren\u2019t revealed too early. \n\r\n\tThe \u2018plot\u2019
    reason for this is\u2026 that the third <mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark> has been
    locked away in a manner much like our protagonist, and for just as long. I <b>think</b>
    that will work, but I might revisit the question later.\n\r\n\tIf I recruit Eren
    to assist me with some of the simpler tasks over the winter break, this ought
    to be doable. Rose is insistent about not overworking herself, so I can\u2019t
    depend on her help during the off-season.\r\n"
