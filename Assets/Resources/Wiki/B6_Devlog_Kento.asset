  Title: looking forwards
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "The <mark=#ffff00aa>puzzle</mark> designs and dialogue for the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    are finished, faster than expected actually. I used the extra time to finally
    draft an <mark=#ffff00aa>ending</mark> to our tale: Our heroic <mark=#ffff00aa>sorcerer</mark>
    uncovers a terrible secret, a spell gone wrong that transformed the third <mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark>
    - his dear friend - into the very <mark=#ffff00aa>necromancer</mark> that hunts
    him. In the climatic finale, he must step forth with a heavy heart to destroy
    the evil he brought into the world.\r\n\r\nI struggled with the finer details
    of it all. Tragedy requires nuance. A tragic hero is one who rises above humankind
    before falling far below it. And the change must be shocking and stark for it
    to have maximum impact. Yet it must also avoid being contrived. The shocking
    yet inevitable fall from grace: something of a literary hat trick. I\u2019ve
    done my best with it. Looking back over the dialogue I\u2019ve written for the
    <mark=#ffff00aa>necromancer</mark>, I\u2019m struck by how similar his voice
    is to someone I used to know, years ago. \r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s best I leave
    it alone: if you manage to channel something raw and real into your story, don\u2019t
    second guess it.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve moved on to the more mechanical aspects of
    the ending. The <mark=#ffff00aa>Sanctum</mark> area is in the early drafts; I\u2019ll
    come back to it once the dust settles post graduation. My workflow is too chaotic
    to focus on it for now. Rose likes to make these constant tiny little pushes
    on KitHub which make clean version control difficult. More than once I\u2019ve
    started work on what I\u2019ve been told is the latest build only to find I\u2019ve
    actually run into conflict with some micro-update she\u2019s made. It would be
    easier if she would just push her work in one wave, so that I could see the full
    scope of potential conflicts. I doubt she\u2019ll want to work nearly this much
    after we graduate, so I should have a more stable foundation to work from then.\r\n\r\nThere
    is one complication: I have a job prospect from Double Lariat Studios. I\u2019ve
    gotten as far as an interview. I would be foolish to turn down an offer from
    them, but I intend to negotiate a delay to beginning my position so I can finish
    <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>.\r"
