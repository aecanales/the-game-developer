  Content: "A week or two before the midsemester progress deadline\r\n\r\nRose is
    trying to push back on how much work Kento is giving her in his overzealousness
    to really deliver on his game\r\n    Says she prefers to underpromise and overdeliver
    \r\n\r\nKento on the other hand is shooting straight for the stars and really
    wants to wow people with the sheer breadth of things he wants to show\r\n   
    Rose: 1) it was their first major milestone and 2) it was an internal check in,
    it\u2019s not like they were pitching to stakeholders or anything\r\n    Kento
    is like well have you done that before? \r\n    Rose: well no but I think my
    point still stands, we shouldn\u2019t go all out for this specific deadline when
    we can keep expectations low and give more than we initially said\r\n     Kento:
    but I want to, it\u2019s our chance to really wow everyone\r\n\r\nRose counters
    that he\u2019s asking a lot of her for this deadline and she will have to pull
    at least one allnighter \r\n     Kento is like well I think we all are, look
    at Eren he\u2019s working hard at things! (screenshot of nonsensical commit comment
    a la Anooj 1am donuts commit)\r\n\r\nRose is like ok but after this we really
    need to talk about scope with our advisor\r\n\r\nKento is like nah it\u2019ll
    be fine, we\u2019re just laying a lot of the groundwork right now! things will
    ease up soon! \r\n\r\nFirst instance of Eren failed STT swear appears here\r\n    
    they do the thing where you repeat a typo someone does in chat\r\n    ask him
    what he meant to say, eren explains Hokkien swears \r\n    Start of it becoming
    a meme \r\n\r\nThis incident also unintentionally kicks the conflict can down
    the road bc convo kinda fizzles out after that\r"
