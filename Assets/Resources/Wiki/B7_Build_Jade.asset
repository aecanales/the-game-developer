  Content: "I\u2019ve compiled an in-progress build with\u2026 well, there\u2019s
    not much. I\u2019ve got a big chunk of the <mark=#ffff00aa>writing</mark> done
    and the basic skeleton for the <mark=#ffff00aa>Ritual</mark> level (formerly
    named Sanctum) laid out, but I need Rose to finish her damn assets so Eren can
    implement them properly. She\u2019s made her displeasure very clear, but I think
    she needs to start being realistic. \r\nAnyways, I\u2019ve named this build <mark=#ffff00aa>Jade</mark>.
    Another nod to all our Asian heritages and a precious stone in ancient times. "
