  Content: "Upset that Kento doesn\u2019t understand that they have limited time
    to work on this game and thus have to limit their scope accordingly\r\n\nAcknowledges
    that she may have overstepped \r\n\nAsserts that this is the best for the project
    - to break people\u2019s hearts early so they don\u2019t dig themselves in too
    deep\r\n\nAlso talks about some art stuff ofc\r\n\nMinotaur art, animation, effects
    all finished\r\n\nMaze 100% done unless they find more bugs\r\n\nNext semester
    will start working on the rest of the assets (frontier and domain maps)\r\n\nTalks
    about how she wants to be extra vigilant about burnout\r"
