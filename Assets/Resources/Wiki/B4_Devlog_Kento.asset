  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Snarks about how much dev time Rose wasted over break by not working
    on the project over break\r\n\tMentions that he wasn\u2019t gonna bother running
    his ideas by Rose but Eren insisted he not think so badly of her and to give
    her a chance\r\n\tSurprisingly she was fine with what he wanted to implement
    but grouses that it was probably only bc she didn\u2019t have to do any extra
    work\r\nThat aside, he talks about what it is he wanted to implement in the first
    place\r\n\tTurning arena from greybox into a more finished state\r\n\tSo he can
    test things in a smaller place both in terms of aesthetics, player feel, and
    mechanics \r\n\tPlaying with different lighting conditions and obstacles\r\n"
