  Content: "- midterm check is finally past whew\r\n- list of assets i've done (standard
    format): \r\n<indent=5%>- <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> (environmental assets mostly,
    some tweaks)\r\n- minotaur (base model, no anims or textures yet)\r\n- <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark>
    magic ui stuff</indent>\r\n- eren hasn't put the maze stuff in engine in yet
    bc he was busy making the game work but the blockout level kento made will look
    so much better once hes able to add them\r\n- but i fuckin pulled an all nighter
    by mistake while working on the <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur</mark> model \r\n<indent=5%>-
    cmon rose you made so much progress on Not Doing That what happened girl</indent>\r\n-
    when i told the others i was pulling back kento seemed like he wanted to encourage
    that behavior though which worries me\r\n<indent=5%>- crunch is an industry thing
    yeah but it\u2019s not good for you long term\r\n- i should probably tell them
    about that one game i crunched like hell on only to release something half baked</indent>\r\n-
    our advisor clover seems to be warning the others away from crunch though which
    is good\r\n<indent=5%>- from what i understand she wants us to focus on broad
    strokes for now and fill in the details next semester \r\n- she also told kento
    that his planned <mark=#ffff00aa>scope</mark> was too big for the time we have
    so hopefully that also helps reduce that stress\r\n- he looked kinda pissed when
    he heard that though \r\n- don\u2019t get me wrong kento is insanely talented
    but hes really not great at social things and i feel like he never bothered to
    learn how to cope</indent> \r\n- i really do wanna make sure that none of us
    crunch on this to the point where our health suffers but kento seems to think
    we need to suffer for our art \r\n"
