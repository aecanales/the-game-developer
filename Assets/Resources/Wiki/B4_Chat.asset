  Content: "Conversation where Kento runs his winter break ideas by Rose and she
    actually likes them to his surprise (he says he didnt expect for someone like
    her to actually agree)\n\r\nRose is like tf did you mean by that bro\n\r\nKento
    offhandedly says she\u2019s a lot like his mother\n\r\nEren tenses up because
    this is not a compliment. \n\r\nRose doesn\u2019t know that though\n\r\nThe conversation
    luckily doesn\u2019t fall apart but it remains tense \r\n"
