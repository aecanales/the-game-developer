  Content: "\tEren is officially out of commission for now. He passed out during
    a job interview and ended up in the ER. I hope he\u2019ll be alright - I wish
    he\u2019d told me how bad it had gotten. \r\n\n\tIn the meantime I tried to export
    another build with what I\u2019ve worked on. All it did was crash on startup,
    though. I put it on the wiki anyway for archival purposes with the name <mark=#ffff00aa>Aventurine</mark>
    - a stone commonly used as a cheaper substitute for <mark=#ffff00aa>jade</mark>.
    Seems fitting.\r\n\n\tRose claims that my attitude was part of the problem, though,
    and stuck to her guns about stonewalling us on her work. Then she claimed that
    we should follow her illustrious example and all stop working on the game for
    a few months. \r\n\n\tWe\u2019re so close. I\u2019m so close. There are plenty
    of things we can do without our lead programmer, but she still refuses to see
    that. I guess I\u2019m the only one who holds any <mark=#ffff00aa>enjoyment</mark>
    of this process anymore. \r\n\n\tAnd my mom says I act as if the world is against
    me. \u2018Act like.\u2019 Our generation is projected to be poorer and shorter
    lived than our parents. Corporations are swallowing the world whole. The planet
    is on fucking fire, for God\u2019s sake. \r\n\n\tI\u2019d like to make a few
    fun video games before the end of the world. I\u2019d like to do it on my own
    terms. \r\n\n\tI don\u2019t want to be rich. I don\u2019t want to be famous.
    I don\u2019t even need people to like my work. \r\n\n\tAnd I\u2019m willing to
    work hard. I have worked hard. All I want to do is spend my time doing what I
    love. \r\n\n\tToo much to ask, I guess. \r"
