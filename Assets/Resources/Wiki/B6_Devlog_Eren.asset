  Title: Showcase
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- The Crimson <mark=#ffff00aa>Phoenix</mark> build has been submitted
    for the end of the class and for the end of year showcase! Huzzah! Hm nope not
    it uh hooray? Woohoo? Uh let\u2019s just move on\r\n- Look I\u2019m just so done
    with being in school\r\n- Call it senioritis or whatever but I\u2019m just ready
    to move on to the next thing\r\n- After Rose finished all the necessary assets
    and Kento finished with his puzzles I was able to import everything into Toonity
    with minimal amounts of <mark=#ffff00aa>crunch</mark>\r\n- Kento\u2019s also
    planning another level for after we graduate\r\n- We\u2019re about 80% there
    and the current plan is to keep on working on this for just a little bit longer
    after school ends\r\n- Then I\u2019ll have the rest of the summer to catch up
    on Solaris vods and campaign for the Momo Magick stylist association election
    hehe\r\n- I still can\u2019t fix that damn visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>
    ugh\r\n- It\u2019s spread to all three of our Toonity installations and sometimes
    the game is entirely unplayable when we export builds, doesn't even matter what
    computer you run it on but other times it\u2019s totally fine\n- Kento has a
    backup of a build that reliably doesn\u2019t transform into a black and white
    Pollockian hellscape but this is shaping up to be a really big problem\r\n- And
    yeah I\u2019ve asked for help but Clover and the rest of our professors are equally
    stumped\r\n- The Toonity devs asked for more info when I emailed them so we\u2019ll
    see what they say to my latest protestation\r\n- In the meantime Rose wanted
    to restructure all of our assets but Kento argued that would take way too much
    time and basically shot her arguments down\r\n- We also had a big conversation
    about <mark=#ffff00aa>post-grad</mark> plans\r\n- I interviewed with a small
    indie studio called Subliminal for a lead programmer role and I\u2019m optimistic
    because they really seemed to like how I navigated the unique programming challenges
    associated with the innovative design of our game\u2019s groundbreaking ludonarrative
    wait ugh there I go again \r\n- What I mean to say is they seemed to appreciate
    how hard I\u2019ve been working on this project and all the bugs I\u2019ve fixed
    \r\n- Fucking interview ease. Um sorry Is it okay to say fuck in a dev log? Eh
    Kento\u2019s probably done it already\r\n- Kento and Rose seem to have cooled
    down from that argument we all had a few months ago but I can tell they\u2019re
    still kind of on edge about it\r\n- So I\u2019m still a bit worried about another
    argument happening again especially since we won\u2019t have scheduled work time
    and advisor meetings anymore once we graduate\r\n- Rose kept trying to talk to
    me about what happened and I think she was trying to get me to take her side
    or something? \r\n- I told her I didn\u2019t want to get involved and she really
    pressed me for my opinion so I said that I did think she was overstepping a little
    bit. \r\n- She just went kinda quiet after that so maybe I shouldn\u2019t have
    told her that\r\n\r\n"
