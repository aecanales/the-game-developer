  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Excitement to be working on a project with someone who\u2019s made really
    interesting narrative and puzzle stuff in the past \r\nPart admiration, part
    \u201Cwell I need to have a game made by a wider team in my portfolio and this
    seemed suitable\u201D \r\nTalks about how modular magic system was actually an
    idea she\u2019d been turning over in her head for a while but didn\u2019t really
    have the design knowledge to implement herself\r\nWhen she grasped what Kento
    was trying to tell her about the narrative it clicked and she was like \u201Coh
    this\u2019ll be perfect\u201D \r\nSays she\u2019s started on assets to fill in
    the greybox of the existing maze level, and talks about going to Playtest Tuesdays
    to iron out some of the kinks\r\nKento seemed hesitant about doing so this early
    but she insisted that they can put together something simple but presentable\r\nGrouses
    a little bit about how Kento seems resistant to implementing gamedev best practice,
    like version control and easy to understand naming systems \r\nMentions that
    Eren smoothed things over by saying they could have both the esoteric build name
    and the version number \r\nCreated the GitHub for the project (HitGlub) and gave
    both Eren and Kento contributor perms\r"
