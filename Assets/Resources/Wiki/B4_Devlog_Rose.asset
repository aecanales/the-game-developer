  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Understandably upset that Kento got mad at her for.. taking a break during
    break. \r\n\tNotes that she saw updates to the builds during break and sighs
    about how much work Kento is throwing at her without prior consultation\r\n\tDid
    appreciate when he talked to her about his ideas instead of just doing \nem (and
    guesses that Eren must have talked him into it)\r\n\nSome more updates: \r\n\tNow
    that the maze is done for the most part she can focus her efforts on the frontier
    and the non-stock arena assets, like new enemies\r\n\tModular magic system still
    needs final icons as well\r\n"
