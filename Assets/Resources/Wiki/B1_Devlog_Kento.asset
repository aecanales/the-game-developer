  Title: Kento's Devlog #1
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Starts off strong - rambles a bit about his vision for the game within
    the Kento Extended Universe before realizing he\u2019s getting off track\r\nTalks
    about the main narrative beats he\u2019s planning (imprisonment of sorcerer and
    attempted escape, some themes of hopelessness and coming after the end, waking
    up to a world that no longer remembers you) \r\nMention that it took a little
    bit for advisor to understand what he was talking about \r\nAdvisor suggested
    onboarding a third person pretty much right after; Kento bristles at it bc he
    assumes the implication is that they\u2019re doubting his skills (but it was
    more of a conversation flow thing) \r\nHow he\u2019s been implementing his narrative
    vision into puzzle systems that will make for both interesting exploration and
    fights\r\nWorries that Rose came up with the idea of the modular magic system
    \u201Csuspiciously fast\u201D but kind of repeats that she couldn\u2019t have
    known about the project beforehand bc Eren wouldn\u2019t tell randos about his
    precious ideas \r\n\u201CEren wouldn\u2019t do that to me. At least, I don\u2019t
    believe he would.\u201D \r\nAt the end notes his reservations about \u201Cpartially
    ceding ownership\u201D of his idea to the group as a whole (Rose in particular)
    but mentions that Eren persuaded him into it\r"
