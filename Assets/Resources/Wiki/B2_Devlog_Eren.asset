  Title: Eren's Devlog #2
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Implemented  new spells modular magic system (kinda broken), minotaur
    fight (it\u2019s functional, but kind of visually sparse), and maze \r\n\nDiscusses
    a few coding problems he had with the build \r \r\n\nManaged to squeak in one
    of the fixes right before the deadline bc Kento was fooling around in the build
    and accidentally fatfingered something that crashed the game\r\n\nTalks about
    how he took a well deserved break the weekend after the check in to catch up
    on sleep, and when he arrived in class the next Tuesday Kento was like \u201Coh
    good you\u2019re here, what do you think about my 38 new ideas\u201D \r\n\nMentions
    that the advisors\u2019 main concern with their game was scope - that Kento might
    be dreaming a little too big for something that should be done by May \r\n\nWorries
    about how Kento is taking it, but mentions that their advisor said they can keep
    things simple this semester and revisit scope in the spring\r\n\nTook that to
    mean that they can pull back a little and see how things shake out in terms of
    realistic completion of stuff and workload\r\n"
