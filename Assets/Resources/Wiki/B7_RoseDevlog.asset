  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Rose saying that this should never have happened in the first place and
    that Kento\u2019s overeagerness and jumping the gun put them in this position
    to begin with. Says that they should give Eren a break and wait for the stable
    release but in a very detached way (statistic instead of person)"
