  Subtitle: Lore
  Content: "The plains were once home to a flourishing technologically and magically
    advanced kingdom (think magic-based Industrial Revolution tech levels)\n\r\nWhile
    this kingdom was ruled by a royal family, power was not limited to those of noble
    birth. Any sufficiently talented or skilled magic user, regardless of social
    status, could rise to positions of power in government, industry, or religion.
    \n\r\nIt is widely believed that magic was a gift granted to humanity by the
    two sages - Nostralia and Reyalita. Worship of these sages and the following
    of their teachings (namely, that magic is meant to be used for the betterment
    of all) is the main method of cultivating and developing one\u2019s magic. \r\n"
