  Content: 'Kento explains the modular magic system or modmagic as they''re calling
    it


    The modularity comes from the combination of spell shapes and spell
    types


    Kento has a lot of plans for types and shapes, but for now Eren has
    only implemented swipe (selected by pressing 1) and beam (selected by pressing
    2)'
