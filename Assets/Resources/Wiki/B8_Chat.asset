  Content: "rose: kento im putting my foot down\r\nrose: either you reduce my workload,
    you reduce your expectations, you hire another artist, or i stop working on this
    entirely\r\nrose: i am stressed, tired, and fed up from work and you trying to
    push me around \r\nrose: and on top of that you keep trying to ignore that <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark>
    even though it came back to haunt us like i said i would\r\nrose: erens barely
    talked in here too arent you at least mildly concerned about what youre doing
    to his <mark=#ffff00aa>health</mark>\r\nKento (Working): I\u2019ve been working
    around the <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark> just fine. Toonity isn\u2019t going
    to fix our problem for us. \r\nKento (Working): And I expect you to honor the
    commitment you made to this project. \r\nKento (Working): You can\u2019t tell
    me you don\u2019t want to at least see this through. \r\nrose: you know kento
    there\u2019s a manager at revolt that acts exactly like you\r\nrose: demanding
    things from his team on unrealistic schedules and making his way the only way
    \r\nrose: you know what happened last week? \r\nrose: he got fired. walked out
    in front of everyone after half his department quit after realizing they would
    actually get treated like humans elsewhere  \r\nKento (Working): I see you\u2019re
    truly found your place at Revolt, then. \r\nKento (Working): A company full of
    people who would rather sit on their hands all day than actually work towards
    something they\u2019re passionate about. \r\nKento (Working): No wonder the recent
    Conference of Champions update was so bad. \r\nNeverending Coding Problems: Guys
    you can\u2019t keep doing this\r\nNeverending Coding Problems: A talk about expectations
    and what each one of us can handle is long overdue\r\nNeverending Coding Problems:
    We can do that now if you two cool down and back off from each other\r\nrose:
    you want me to back off? \r\nrose: remember how kento literally said last month
    that you guys only brought me on because i was useful? \r\nrose: clearly you
    never thought of me as more than a means to end so why bother trying to fix this\r\nNeverending
    Coding Problems: Rose that isn\u2019t true\r\nNeverending Coding Problems: You
    know you were one of the first friends I made in the program\r\nNeverending Coding
    Problems: We\u2019ve genuinely enjoyed having you on the team\r\nrose: \u201Cwe\u201D?
    dont make me laugh\r\nrose: did you conveniently forget what kento said to me
    just because you guys are besties\r\nNeverending Coding Problems: Rose I promise
    he didn\u2019t mean it\r\nrose: speak for him all you want. i\u2019m not stupid
    enough to believe that\r"
