  Title: T-Posing Minotaurs and Scope Struggle
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "[SCRIPT] \r\nAlright, this is my second devlog. We\u2019ve finally hit
    the middle of the semester, our midterm progress presentations were last week,
    and we just got the feedback from that. Though I should probably talk about what
    I worked on for that milestone first, haha. \n\r\nSince my last devlog, I\u2019ve
    successfully implemented the modular magic system, though it is kinda broken
    still. Most of the components work, but I\u2019m still ironing out some bugs
    when it comes to actually combining them and using them on overworld objects.
    The minotaur fight at the end of the maze is functional, but still kind of visually
    sparse. We don\u2019t have the animations for them yet, so they just T-pose after
    you while yelling their boss lines. It\u2019s very funny. \n\r\nI also tried
    out a new save load system, where you can press [KEY] to save, close the game,
    and then press [OTHER KEY] to load your progress after you open it again. Turns
    out this was crashing the game, but we only found out because Kento was fooling
    around in the build right before the deadline and accidentally pressed [KEY THAT
    CRASHES THE GAME] instead. I did manage to squeak in a fix, though. \n\r\nThe
    faculty\u2019s main concern with our game was scope, aside from a few mechanical
    things I can fix next week. They thought that Kento might be dreaming a little
    too big for something that should be done by May, and I suppose they\u2019re
    right. I am worried about how Kento is taking the news though. It was already
    a really big step for him to bring one of his stories out into the open. I hope
    he doesn\u2019t take it too personally. \r\n"
