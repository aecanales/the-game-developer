  Title: FREEDOM
  Subtitle: 'Rose '
  Content: "- IM FREE KINDA\r\n- things i did for spring showcase build: \r\n<indent=5%>-
    finished all remaining boss models (with a different method of linking them to
    the proper scripts)\r\n- finished all enemies</indent>\r\n- i wanted to scale
    down the final deliverable so i could fix all our old assets and hopefully solve
    that bug we ran into in march but kento insisted i not waste my time with that\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i gave in because i still felt terrible about the dgc thing but that\u2019s the
    first thing i\u2019m going to fix over the summer </indent>\r\n- for a few days
    before the deadline i kept feeling compelled to go back and tweak little things
    about the textures and models and anims\r\n<indent=5%>- tbh i\u2019m really worried
    about whether or not this game is polished enough\u2026 this is the biggest project
    i\u2019ve worked on so far and it needs to impress</indent>\r\n- i\u2019ve really
    been working hard this past while to try and make up for my <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark>
    mistake\r\n<indent=5%>- maybe i got a little defensive but honestly kento came
    in swinging so what was i supposed to do, just sit there and take it like i always
    did as a kid?\r\n- accidentally did a few more late nights but no all nighters
    so that\u2019s a small win for me at least. no <mark=#ffff00aa>crunch</mark>
    allowed in this house\r\n- i hope i\u2019m not pissing kento off with all the
    kithub pushes\u2026 maybe if i go play underwatch and nolife in ranked for a
    little bit itll help </indent>\r\n- as for my <mark=#ffff00aa>post-grad</mark>
    plans: i\u2019m waiting to hear back from revolt games after our final interview
    \r\n<indent=5%>- here\u2019s hoping i get the position! \r\n- oh yeah i said
    i\u2019d send them the final showcase build when we were done lemme go do that</indent>\r\n"
