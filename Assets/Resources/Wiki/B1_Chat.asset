  Title: Chat Log
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Flesh out post-advisor meeting context\r\n\nMostly good news from advisor,
    who says they\u2019re making good progress on both the modular magic idea (they
    want to see more of that specifically) and the overall narrative skeleton\r\nRose
    is like oh wow I really didn\u2019t think the modmagic idea would be so well
    received, I was just kinda tossing the idea around\u2026 \r\n\nKento is a little
    miffed that the modmagic seemed to be the standout feature instead of his narrative
    (which the advisor said was good, just needed some more clarity - they said the
    problem was that it was all in his brain and it needed to come out onto paper)\r\n\nEren
    is like wow haha I love working with my friends! \r\n"
