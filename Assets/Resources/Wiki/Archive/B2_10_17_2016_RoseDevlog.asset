  Content: "- i am so goddamn tired\r\n- our last few meetings have been mostly about
    scope for the midsemester deadline\r\n- as usual i was planning to stick to keeping
    expectations low/average and overdelivering if we could\r\n- kento wanted to
    shoot for the stars though and was really pushing for us to get the maze level
    finished\r\n- i told him that i would have to do a lot of extra work to get it
    done because i have other classes and other midterms to study for\r\n- he didn\u2019t
    listen though and kept saying that it was really important that we wow everyone
    for this deadline\r\n<indent=2%>- like\u2026 dude we\u2019re barely two months
    into the dev process, it\u2019s not a race</indent>\r\n- eren agreed with kento
    and said that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to implement the assets when i had
    them done\r\n- normally i would push back more but kento already went and told
    our advisor about his planned scope for the deadline so i guess i don\u2019t
    really have a choice\u2026 \r\n- stuff to finish by next week: \r\n<indent=2%>-
    maze textures and tilesets</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>- first boss animations</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-
    all modular magic animations</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>- basic UI for like. everything</indent>\r"
