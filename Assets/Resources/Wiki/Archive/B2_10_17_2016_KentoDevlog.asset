  Title: Third Devlog - Kento
  Subtitle: Why does magic grace the world? Because I toiled to make it so.
  Content: "Our midsemester progress deadline is coming up, and it\u2019s crucial
    that we really wow our advisor and the rest of the professors for it. It\u2019s
    our big chance to show everyone that The Last Sorcerer isn\u2019t just any old
    game. \r\nAs such, I\u2019m planning for us to have the maze level finished by
    next week. The modular magic system has been working really well, and we\u2019ve
    decided to transition over to using it as our main gameplay mechanic. Currently,
    we have a small but solid number of both spell shapes and spell effects, as well
    as valid outputs for all possible combinations. I\u2019ve been making great progress
    on the narrative as well, and plan to have a voiceover recorded for the deadline.
    \r\nRose has been trying to push back on the big build, though. I don\u2019t
    see the issue - she\u2019s been making good progress on updating all our assets,
    and it\u2019s work she\u2019ll need to do anyway. Why delay it when we can put
    it in now? Besides, I decided to capitulate and implement her modular magic idea.
    This team is a two-way street, after all. \r\nI did manage to get through to
    her in the end, so all\u2019s well that ends well. Our <i>advisor</i> is super
    on board with the idea too, and I\u2019m excited to knock his socks off. \r"
