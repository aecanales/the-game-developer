  Title: Ambition.

  Content: "\tI was pleasantly surprised by the midterm feedback on our second build,
    codenamed <mark=#ffff00aa>Thalia</mark>. I expected to comb through a rat\u2019s
    nest of surface level criticism, which is what I\u2019ve come to expect from
    faculty. But the response was actually quite positive, if not terribly substantive.
    The thrust of their suggestion was \u201CDon\u2019t be too ambitious on <mark=#ffff00aa>scope</mark>.\u201D
    (I think that was the quote.) Which is deeply unhelpful feedback for a narrative
    game.\r\n\r\n\tLet\u2019s consider what an unambitious game narrative looks like.
    In the best case scenario, we\u2019d have a genre pastiche of a piece of nerd
    ephemera - Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dawn of the Dead, etc. - in the form
    of a movie with gameplay begrudgingly attached to it. (A movie with terrible
    production quality given we\u2019re a team of three to boot.) \r\n\r\n\tAmbition
    is all we have. If our game doesn\u2019t stand out, if it doesn\u2019t command
    attention, it won\u2019t get any. What else can that feedback accomplish besides
    engendering mediocrity? The acceptance of mediocrity is why I never work with
    teams on any project with a complex story. Games are a medium in which not having
    a story is preferable to a perfunctory one, because then at least the gameplay
    goes uninterrupted. I\u2019ve lost track of how many times I tried to explain
    that to my last team. But I think maybe Eren gets it, which is a nice surprise.\r\n\r\n\tThough
    to be honest I find myself disagreeing with Rose\u2019s perspective on the issue.
    We\u2019re having a productive semester: the first level is nearly done - all
    her assets are in place to be implemented and only the <mark=#ffff00aa>Minotaur</mark>
    remains unfinished. And she\u2019s already talking about burnout. Not even half
    a year into a project.\r\n\r\n\tThe positive feedback we\u2019ve received so
    far is contingent upon the pace we\u2019re keeping. The \u201Clost sleep\u201D
    she\u2019s trying to prevent is the very thing that allowed us to get this far.
    I don\u2019t know how to explain to her that this is just what it means to make
    art under capitalism. She\u2019s smart enough to know that and she\u2019s done
    good work so far. I have faith that she\u2019ll come to see things my way.\r\n"
