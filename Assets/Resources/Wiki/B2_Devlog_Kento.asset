  Title: Kento's Devlog #2
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Modular magic system is still pretty rudimentary and has a ton of bugs
    right now. Still need to work at it until it\u2019s good\n\r\nMaze design finalized
    and implemented with assets from Rose for midterm\r\nMinotaur boss fight is also
    functional! Still needs the bells and whistles, but you can fight him\n\r\nTalks
    about how (from his perspective) things went pretty well for the midsemester
    deadline, despite Rose\u2019s complaining\n\r\nEven says he jumped right into
    the feedback he got and came up with lots of new ideas! Some were even ready
    for Eren to implement the next week! \n\r\nThanks Eren for fixing something last
    minute before they presented\r\n\nComplains that Rose doesn\u2019t seem to understand
    that more hands on the project means more work that can be done, and wonders
    if she just isn\u2019t as committed as he is\n\r\nSure, she pulled an alllnighter,
    but sometimes you just gotta crunch\n\r\nShe should know this since she made
    so many more games that they did \n\r\nTalks about how their advisor also seemed
    to agree that they should keep going at their pace and that they can always reevaluate
    next semester\n\r\nEren is onboard, so that means that things are going well!
    Rose might need a little convincing but she\u2019ll come around\r\n"
