  Content: "Right before this, advisor (during their meeting) wonders why they didn\u2019t
    submit for DGC (GDC clone)\n\r\nRose says they weren\u2019t ready and changes
    the subject\n\r\nEren and Kento ask her why afterward bc she was in charge of
    that\n\r\nRose said she forgot and brushes them off because (to her) the game
    wasn\u2019t in a polished enough state to submit for the DGC showcase \n\r\nEren
    is like \u201Cwell youve done this before, I suppose your judgment is sound\u2026\u201D
    and is sad about it\n\r\nKento is pissed and said she should have told them\r\n"
