  Title: midterm conquered
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- midterm check is finally past whew\r\n- list of <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    i've done (standard format): \r\n<indent=5%>- <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> (environmental
    assets mostly, some tweaks)</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>- <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur</mark>
    (model)</indent>\r\n- eren hasn't put them in engine in yet but the blockout
    <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> kento made will look so much better once he adds
    them in the next build (did kento say something about merriment?)\r\n- i fuckin
    pulled an all nighter by mistake while working on the <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur</mark>
    model \r\n<indent=5%>- cmon rose you made so much progress on Not Doing That
    what happened girl</indent>\r\n- when i told the others kento seemed like he
    wanted to encourage that behavior though which worries me\r\n<indent=5%>- crunch
    is an industry thing yeah but it\u2019s not good for you long term</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i should probably tell them about <mark=#ffff00aa>the last knight</mark> and
    how i crunched like hell on that only to release something half baked</indent>\r\n-
    our advisor clover seems to be warning the others away from crunch though which
    is good\r\n<indent=5%>- from what i understand she wants us to focus on broad
    strokes for now and fill in the details next semester</indent> \r\n<indent=5%>-
    she also told kento that his planned scope was too big for the time we have so
    hopefully that also helps reduce that stress</indent>\r\n- i really do wanna
    make sure that none of us crunch on this to the point where our health suffers\r\n"
