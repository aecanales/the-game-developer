  Content: "modmagic is a modular magic system where spell shapes and types come
    together to create unique spells. like for example you can have a spell type
    that pushes enemies, but you will have different shapes like a short swipe or
    a long beam that will have different uses based on the enemies you're fighting.\r\n\r\neren
    still has to do work to get all the shapes and types done, but the first build
    he made has two shapes the player can play with: swipe (press 1) and beam (press
    2). i think this has a great potential for puzzles, like that you need to use
    a specifc shape like beam to destroy a wall, so I was testing that in the first
    build eren made.\r"
