Wiki
- Homepage
- Load file from scriptable object
- Search
    - Would be nice to have to search history
- Hyperlinks
- And download

- I really want to replace the game hub with a file explorer

- populate emails and chat... maybe home too?
- would love to have some sheets on the desktop...

(the wiki is basically a notion page?)
(this is more of a thesis ii, but I'd love to have a centralized place to add content from the main scene to not have to dive into the depths of the hierarchy each time, especially since Im using a narrow subset)
(the dynamic story telling system sucks, I need to make something custom when its time to actually write content, but also a thesis ii thing)
