  Title: Eren's Devlog #3
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Talks about some issues he had with the builds during playtesting \r\n\tPeople
    kept shooting a character that was giving them instructions so he made it an
    Adorable Dog\r\n\tThere was a bug where if you walked into a particular part
    of the maze it would crash\r\n\tFinal full implementation of the maze and its
    minotaur boss and can move on to the frontier next semester! Expects that Kento
    will have lots of things for him to do over break \r\n\nWorries about the growing
    resentment between Kento and Rose\r\n\tSays he\u2019s been trying to keep the
    peace between them \r\n\tThings seem to have at least temporarily resolved between
    them once their advisor gave them advice\r\n\nGlad they\u2019ve made a lot of
    progress this semester!\r\n\tMentions that he was worried about how Kento would
    react to letting one of his brainchildren be worked on by others (knew there
    would be conflict) but is happy it\u2019s worked out (at time of writing)\r\n"
