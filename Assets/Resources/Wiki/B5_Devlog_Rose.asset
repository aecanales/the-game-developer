  Title: im sorry
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- i\u2019m really, really sorry i forgot to submit for <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i swear i wrote the date down correctly but i mixed it up with the tax filing
    deadline for this year\r\n- i know it doesn\u2019t look great for me since i
    was really wanting to show something polished at <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark> but
    i promise i didn\u2019t forget on purpose</indent>\n- but kento seems to have
    decided in his head that i hate him and his game and am just fucking out to get
    him like his mom did when he was 12 or something\r\n<indent=5%>- dude your 23rd
    birthday was last week you should know better than to lay the blame for your
    trauma on others\r\n- and you know what contributes to my memory problems? information
    overload. large amounts of meaningless deadlines and being endlessly pushy for
    more more more more more\r\n- i was dead set on giving him a piece of my mind
    right then and there but 1) i felt horrendous already i love rsd and 2) eren
    timed us BOTH out for something that was clearly his friends fault\r\n- ugh i
    cant finish this now ill come back tomorrow</indent>\r\n\n\r\nupdate 3/17:\r\n-
    i figured out why my <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark> were causing that visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    it was because toonity changed how their assets link into the engine\u2019s systems
    \r\n- one of the methods i was using to define parameters changed in a really
    weird way\r\n- i\u2019m gonna have to change how my <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    are structured now\r\n- still haven\u2019t fixed the originals bc i really had
    to get the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> ones done \r\n- eren found a temp
    fix but we had to take <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark> out of the midterm build
    bc that was where the flashing problem was</indent> \r\n- but i managed to finish
    the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> assets on time without any all nighters\r\n-
    i can't be forgetting things again this time. i've told a couple of companies
    i\u2019ve been interviewing with about <mark=#ffff00aa>trismegistus</mark> and
    if i show them something unpolished it\u2019s on me\r\n"
