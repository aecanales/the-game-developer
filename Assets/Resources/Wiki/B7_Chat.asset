  Content: "Kentusle: Rose, I need you to pick up the pace on the necromancer model.
    \r\nKentusle: Without it, I can\u2019t finish designing half the fight. You are
    the biggest bottleneck in our development process and I\u2019m starting to think
    you\u2019re doing it on purpose. \r\nwilting rose: kento i have a full time job
    making 3d models\r\nwilting rose: can you stop coming after me for this and let
    me go at my own pace\r\nwilting rose: its getting very old\r\nKentusle: Using
    your big girl job as an excuse again? \r\nKentusle: At your pace, I\u2019ll be
    dead and buried before you finish with the necromancer. \r\nwilting rose: its
    not a fucking excuse its an explanation \r\nwilting rose: im using my \u201Cbig
    girl job\u201D that i worked my ass off to get as an explanation because god
    forbid i have any fucking time for myself \r\nKentusle: I saw you playing Underwatch
    for 6 hours this weekend. You could have spent that time actually doing something
    productive.\r\nwilting rose: oh for fucks sake now youre starting to sound like
    MY dad\r\nKentusle: And? \r\nwilting rose: and im telling you that you need to
    pull back on your deadlines\r\nwilting rose: just because you have all the time
    to work on your precious game doesnt mean i do\r\nwilting rose: if you arent
    willing to respect that, fine, there are plenty of talented artists out there
    with more than enough time to indulge your micromanagement. just hire one of
    them\r\nKentusle: I am not hiring another artist to pick up your slack. This
    is ridiculous. \r\nKentusle: I wouldn\u2019t need to micromanage you if you just
    buckled in and got your work done! \r\nwilting rose: and we wouldnt be having
    this conversation if you were a good teammate, would we? no wonder no one wants
    to hire you\r\nKentusle: I\u2019ve had ENOUGH of your shit. \r\nKentusle: You
    know I didn\u2019t even want you on the project to begin with, right? \r\nKentusle:
    We only added you because you were good at art. \r\nwilted rose: \u2026and not
    because you and eren were my friends and genuinely wanted to work with me?\r\nKentusle:
    Don\u2019t kid yourself. If I could go back in time I\u2019d never have done
    that if I knew you would be stonewalling the project. \r\nwilted rose: and if
    i could go back in time id have told myself to stay away from the weird edgy
    wasian kid who looks like he dyes his hair for attention because his mother never
    loved him\r\nwilted rose: but we cant have it all, can we? \r\nKentusle: You
    take that back. \r\nwilted rose: why would i bother being civil with someone
    who clearly just used me for my skills? \r\nwilted rose: maybe if you stop stewing
    in your angst for half a second you\u2019ll finally figure out why your brother
    is the favorite\r\nKentusle: And maybe if YOU stop being so contrarian people
    will want you for more than just your skills. \r\nNot Lai-king This Job Hunt:
    Yet another <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark> rejected\r\nNot Lai-king This Job
    Hunt: Oh my god the chat didn\u2019t scroll down what the fuck happened here\r\nNot
    Lai-king This Job Hunt: Guys you can\u2019t keep fighting like this\r"
