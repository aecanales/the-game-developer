  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Rose upset that Kento doesn\u2019t understand that they have limited
    time to work on this game and thus have to limit their scope accordingly. Acknowledges
    that she may have overstepped but asserts that this is the best for the project.
    Also talks about some design stuff"
