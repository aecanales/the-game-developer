  Content: "- excited to be working on <mark=#ffff00aa>trismegistus</mark> with eren
    and kento!! \r\n<indent=5%>- eren does witchcraft with his code that not even
    i understand\r\n- kento\u2019s made really interesting narrative/puzzle stuff
    in the past and i can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019s got planned for... what
    did he name it? trigonometry? idk </indent>\r\n- <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark>
    magic system was actually an idea i\u2019d been chewing on for a while but i
    didn\u2019t really have the design knowledge to do it myself\r\n<indent=5%>-
    the whole a + b = c thing has to consider pretty much every combination\r\n-
    coding for that is way beyond what little i know lmfao</indent>\r\n- when i finally
    figured out what kento was trying to tell me about the narrative it just kinda
    clicked yknow\r\n- anyways i\u2019ve started working on <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    to start building better looking levels, mostly to make it presentable before
    we can take it to playtest tuesdays\r\n<indent=5%>- kento was kinda hesitant
    to show it off so early but we need to know if the <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark>
    magic is working as intended</indent>\r\n- speaking of kento i\u2019m pretty
    sure this guy is allergic to gamedev best practices\r\n- <indent=5%>i made a
    kithub for the game bc apparently eren has just been storing this on his personal
    server???\r\n- also kento keeps naming his builds esoteric things.  like based
    on the greek charities?? this first one is named <mark=#ffff00aa>aglaea</mark>
    i think\n- i keep telling him they need actual version numbers so he compromised
    and added both\r\n- both of em have contributor perms now (though idk if they\u2019ll
    use em)</indent>\r\n"
