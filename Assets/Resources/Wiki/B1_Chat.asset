  Content: "KentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): good meeting! what did you guys think\r\nrosygoldart
    (art): im so glad that the modular magic idea meshed so well with what you brought
    in at the start of the year\r\nrosygoldart (art): i really didnt think itd work
    that well\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Even our advisor Clover was shocked, I
    think. Rare to see that on her. \r\nrosygoldart (art): yea i think the only other
    time ive seen her like that was when the dept chair covered everything in her
    office in tinfoil for april fools\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): i would
    hope that \u201Cpleasantly shocked\u201D and \u201Cwhat the fuck is happening\u201D
    look markedly different on her\u2026\r\nrosygoldart (art): cmon you know what
    i mean\r\nrosygoldart (art): like\r\nrosygoldart (art): shes always so chill
    and cool\r\nrosygoldart (art): we rarely see her facade crack\r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    Yeah, it was nice to see her emote a little more than she normally does, haha.
    \r\nerenlaiii (programming): But back to business. \r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    Clover said they wanted to see a little more from the modular magic idea by our
    midterm check-in, so we should definitely make that one of our top priorities.
    \r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): don\u2019t forget the overall narrative
    skeleton too! \r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): that\u2019s one of the most
    important parts of the game\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Oh, yeah, of course.
    \r\nrosygoldart (art): i think clovers just having a bit of a hard time imagining
    whats in ur head lol\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): well where else would
    it be? \r\nrosygoldart (art): on paper somewhere? \r\nrosygoldart (art): kinda
    hard for people to read ur mind and figure out what ur cooking for the game\r\nerenlaiii
    (programming): Rose is right, Kento. I think a brain dump would help to just
    get everything out of your head? \r\nerenlaiii (programming): It doesn\u2019t
    need to be neat, just accessible to others. \r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    i mean i guess i can give it a shot\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): you know
    i\u2019ve never done anything like this before eren \r\nrosygoldart (art): wait
    fr\r\nrosygoldart (art): i totally thought you would be the kind of lore guy
    with like 30000 google docs \r\nerenlaiii (programming): This\u2019ll be a fruitful
    semester, I think! \r\nerenlaiii (programming): When did you guys want to meet
    oh hello there Mooncake. Can I help you? Oh ow don\u2019t do that. See you not.
    \r\nrosygoldart (art): huh whuh\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): oh mooncake
    probably walked in while he was in the middle of speech to text\r\nKentoWrites
    (narrative/puzzles): happens all the time\r\nrosygoldart (art): ohhhh\r\nerenlaiii
    (programming): Sorry about that. The child is now contained. \r\nrosygoldart
    (art): i demand pictures of the child\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Attachment
    (mooncake.png)\r\nrosygoldart (art): OH MY GOD\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    ah, mischievous as ever \r\nrosygoldart (art): ok but howd the speech to text
    end up with see you not lmao\r\nrosygoldart (art): what were you trying to say\r\nerenlaiii
    (programming): Oh, it butchered a Hokkien phrase I use a lot. \r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    \u201CSee jen na\u201D means \u201Cbad kid\u201D, and I guess speech to text
    had a bit of an aneurysm. \r\nerenlaiii (programming): One of the many hazards
    of being dyslexic.\r\nrosygoldart (art): its funny though\r\nrosygoldart (art):
    see you not mooncake\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): see you not mooncake\r\nerenlaiii
