  Title: FREEDOM
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- IM FREE KINDA\r\n- things i did for spring showcase build: \r\n<indent=5%>-
    finally fixed the fucking arena assets (though now eren thinks the problem is
    how they\u2019re hooked into the 3d models so that\u2019s great\u2026)\r\n- finished
    all arena boss models \r\n- finished all enemies\r\n- frontier stuff is done
    too but that was relatively quick compared to this</indent>\r\n- ok maybe i\u2019m
    not as free as i would think bc i keep going back and tweaking little things
    about the textures and models and anims\r\n<indent=5%>- tbh i\u2019m really worried
    about whether or not this game is polished enough\u2026 i had an interview with
    revolt games last week and i said i\u2019d send them the final showcase build
    when we were done\r\n- mental note i need to do that<indent=5%>\r\n- i\u2019ve
    really been working hard this past few weeks to try and make up for my dgc mistake\r\n<indent=5%>-
    accidentally did a few more late nights but no all nighters so that\u2019s a
    small win for me at least\r\n- i still feel absolutely horrid about that i can\u2019t
    b elieve i was so forgetful and mixed up the dates like that\r\n- kento seems
    to have moved past it but i can\u2019t help but feel that he\u2019s still a little
    frosty sometimes\r\n- i hope i\u2019m not pissing him off with all the kithub
    pushes </indent>\r\n"
