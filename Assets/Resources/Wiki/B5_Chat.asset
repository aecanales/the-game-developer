  Content: "Sisyphus Moment: rose you really just \u201Cforgot\u201D to submit for
    dgc? and we only find out when we talk to clover during our advising meeting?\r\nSisyphus
    Moment: don\u2019t think i don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to\r\ntoonity
    update anti: kento please i promise i didnt do it on purpose i just forgot\r\ntoonity
    update anti: you guys know my memory is really bad\r\ntoonity update anti: i
    mixed it up with the tax filing deadline for this year bc the numbers are reversed\r\ntoonity
    update anti: 13th and 31st\r\nSisyphus Moment: after all you\u2019ve been saying
    about not wanting to put my hard work in the game? and you expect me to believe
    you didn\u2019t do it on purpose?\r\nSisyphus Moment: for god\u2019s sake don\u2019t
    you at least WRITE THINGS DOWN\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Kento, being overly
    accusatory isn\u2019t gonna help us with anything, please stop.\r\nSisyphus Moment:
    well then what am i supposed to be doing then? \r\nSisyphus Moment: just letting
    the biggest opportunity we\u2019ve ever had to get our game out there slide?
    \r\nSisyphus Moment: don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re on her side now\r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: I\u2019m not taking sides, I just want us to be objective about
    this. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: The 13th and 31st are very similar dates,
    and I can see how Rose would have mixed them up if they both had important deadlines
    tied to them. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Besides, raking her over the coals
    is only going to make things worse. We\u2019re still a team, and we can work
    this out without fighting. \r\ntoonity update anti: please kento dont misunderstand
    ive always been really bad with deadlines\r\ntoonity update anti: i didnt mean
    to forget im so sorry\r\ntoonity update anti: ill do better next time i promise\r\nSisyphus
    Moment: that\u2019s what my parents would always say to me every time they forgot
    something that was important to me\r\nSisyphus Moment: every single birthday,
    every single milestone or award. \r\nSisyphus Moment: they didn\u2019t even bother
    coming to my high school graduation because they \u201Cforgot\u201D my brother\u2019s
    6th grade award ceremony on the same day. \r\nSisyphus Moment: every time they
    would say the same thing\r\nSisyphus Moment: \u201Coh i\u2019m so sorry i forgot.
    i\u2019ll definitely remember next time\u201D\r\nSisyphus Moment: they never
    fucking did. \r\nSisyphus Moment: so why should i believe you? \r\ntoonity update
    anti: kento please im sorry that happened to you but im not your parents \r\ntoonity
    update anti: ill do better next time i swear on my life \r\nFlashing Lights Warning:
    Rose, there\u2019s no need to keep apologizing. You don\u2019t have to grovel
    for forgiveness. \r\nSisyphus Moment: and yet you\u2019ve done the same thing
    they\u2019ve always done\r\nSisyphus Moment: why should i believe you? \r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: Kento, lay off of Rose. Shaming her for forgetting an optional
    deadline isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere. \r\nSisyphus Moment: eren don\u2019t
    pretend you aren\u2019t disappointed in rose too\r\nSisyphus Moment: clearly
    no one\u2019s ever told her that her little mistakes have consequences, so i
    will \r\ntoonity update anti: i know they do kento my dads told me this a million
    times please im sorry i wont do it ag ain\r\nSisyphus Moment: people like you
    are always the same. hiding behind forgetfulness as an excuse\r\nFlashing Lights
    Warning: Both of you, that\u2019s ENOUGH. \r\n[KentoWrites has been placed in
    timeout by erenlaiii.]\r\n[rosygoldart has been placed in timeout by erenlaiii.]\r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: Both of you are going to stop talking in here, calm down, and
    sleep this off. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: We\u2019ll address this properly
    tomorrow. \r"
