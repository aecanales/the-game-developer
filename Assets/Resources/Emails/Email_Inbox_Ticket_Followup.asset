  mailContent: "Hey Carlos,\r\n\r\nThe support team over at Comply Inc. got back
    to us again about that Earned Income Credit (EIC) calculation discrepancy. They\u2019ve
    asked if we could \u201Creconfirm the eligibility thresholds\u201D and provide
    a line-by-line breakdown of our calculation flow. I know you reviewed this last
    month, but they\u2019re pushing for more documentation and clarification on the
    initial glitch.\r\n\r\nIf you could resend the query logs and summarize the original
    issue in layman's terms, I\u2019ll follow up with them. They\u2019re looking
    for reassurance that the fix will carry through into next year\u2019s filings.
    Appreciate it\u2014let\u2019s get this off our plate ASAP.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCarlos"
