  Title: fights, bosses.

  Content: "ok maybe i\u2019m starting to understand why rose was so gung ho on warning
    me off of all nighters. i\u2019m so tired. \n\r\nbut once i catch up on sleep
    i can work on a whole new aspect of trismegistus! i have so much planned that
    i want to do. i\u2019ve got to expand fully on the story outline i wrote earlier
    this semester, work on the game design document, finalize all the modular magic
    spells, come up with some more enemies so rose can get started on the 3d models\u2026
    \n\r\nspeaking of story, i did end up tweaking it a little bit based on feedback
    from playtesters and clover. i\u2019ve decided that there are three sages now
    instead of two, and the third sage (called Immuta) is related to the reason why
    the sorcerer has ended up trapped in the maze. it\u2019ll all be in the story
    document since i don\u2019t think my ramblings about it would fit in this dev
    log\n\r\nas for my plans for the rest of the game, each sage will have a separate
    arena-based boss rush accessible from the frontier map. i\u2019m planning to
    have the original two sages unlock the way to the third sage, who has been shut
    away for as long as the sorcerer has been in the maze \n\r\ni\u2019ll likely
    also be asking eren for help adding some of the more basic parts of my to-do
    items over winter break since rose is so insistent on not overworking herself.
    she\u2019d tell me to leave them for the start of the semester, you know how
    she is\r"
