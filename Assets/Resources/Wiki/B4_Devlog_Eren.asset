  Content: "- So I took a break over break\r\n- Bet you\u2019ll never guess who didn\u2019t
    take a break \r\n- He seemed kind of upset that Rose wasn\u2019t working on the
    game the whole time too\r\n- We hit the ground running as soon as we got back
    like we agreed upon before we left for break but there\u2019s still some friction\r\n-
    I feel like Kento\u2019s still kind of a solo flyer which is going to have to
    change if we\u2019re to keep working as a group\r\n- Besides it\u2019s not fair
    to say that Rose didn\u2019t do anything for the game over break\r\n- She came
    up with a new 3D modeling technique that\u2019s gonna speed things up a lot\r\n-
    Kento\u2019s just mad that she didn\u2019t try it out on the game first\r\n-
    I get why she didn\u2019t and well\r\n- I would have helped her to get that working\r\n-
    But anyway, I\u2019m rambling. Our workflows are gonna be a lot better now and
    that is a good thing tm\r\n- I\u2019ve been chipping away at the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    level since the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> is progressing pretty well\r\n-
    It\u2019s mostly building out tools and providing a template for Kento to go
    in later on and develop stuff like mechanics tone and lighting\r\n- Also patched
    a few bugs from an engine update last month\r\n- Kento\u2019s named this build
    White <mark=#ffff00aa>Tiger</mark> \r\n- Rose is still working on the final assets
    for both the frontier and arena levels \r\n- Thankfully her old stuff was set
    up to be interchangeable which means I can use them as placeholders for the later
    levels\r\n- That\u2019s the kind of foresight that game dev experience gets you!
    \r\n- Clover suggested that we should submit our game to this year\u2019s <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark>
    indie showcase! \r\n- Even though it\u2019s just a midterm build the maze level
    by itself more than meets the over five minutes requirement\r\n- We can definitely
    set aside a week or so for promo material\r\n- We\u2019ve got a checklist of
    things we want to have in the game by the mid March deadline \r\n- Kento and
    Rose argued a little about the details but that\u2019s to be expected\r\n- Rose
    will be handling the submission form since she\u2019s done this before.\r\n-
    Super excited for more people to see our game smiley face\r\n- No why isn\u2019t
    the emoji thing working god dammit\r\n- Gonna say see you not to this damn software\r\n"
