  Content: "KentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): That was a productive meeting. What
    did you guys think?\r\nrosygoldart (art): im so glad that my <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark>
    magic idea meshed so well with what you brought in at the start of the year\r\nrosygoldart
    (art): i really didnt think itd work that well\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Even
    our advisor Clover was shocked haha that was unexpected\r\nrosygoldart (art):
    yea i think the only other time ive seen her like that was when the dept chair
    covered everything in her office in tinfoil for april fools\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    I would hope that pleasant shock and abject confusion look markedly different
    on her. \r\nrosygoldart (art): cmon you know what i mean\r\nrosygoldart (art):
    like\r\nrosygoldart (art): shes always so chill and cool\r\nrosygoldart (art):
    we rarely see her facade crack\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Yeah it was nice to
    see her emote a little more than she normally does haha\r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    But back to business\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Clover said they wanted to see
    a little more from the modular magic idea by our midterm check-in so we should
    definitely make that one of our top priorities\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    Don\u2019t forget the overall narrative outline. That\u2019s the most important
    part of my vision for <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>.\r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    Oh yeah of course\r\nrosygoldart (art): i think clovers just having a bit of
    a hard time imagining whats in ur head lol\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    Where else would my ideas be? \r\nrosygoldart (art): on paper somewhere? \r\nrosygoldart
    (art): kinda hard for people to read ur mind and figure out what ur cooking for
    the game\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Rose is right Kento. I think a brain dump
    would help to just get everything out of your head\r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    It doesn\u2019t need to be neat, just accessible to us\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    \u2026 I suppose I could give that a try. \r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles):
    You know how I am about putting my ideas to paper, Eren.  \r\nrosygoldart (art):
    wait fr\r\nrosygoldart (art): i totally thought you would be the kind of lore
    guy with like 30000 google docs \r\nerenlaiii (programming): This\u2019ll be
    a fruitful semester I think! \r\nerenlaiii (programming): When did you guys want
    to meet oh hello there Mooncake. Can I help you? Oh ow don\u2019t do that see
    you not\r\nrosygoldart (art): huh whuh\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): His
    cat Mooncake probably walked in while he was in the middle of speech to text\r\nKentoWrites
    (narrative/puzzles): She\u2019ll be a mainstay in our conversations. \r\nrosygoldart
    (art): ohhhh\r\nerenlaiii (programming): Sorry about that the child is now contained\r\nrosygoldart
    (art): i demand pictures of the child\r\nerenlaiii (programming): (DCIM_34556.png)\r\nrosygoldart
    (art): OH MY GOD\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): Mischievous as ever, Mooncake.
    \r\nrosygoldart (art): ok but howd the speech to text end up with see you not
    lmao\r\nrosygoldart (art): what were you trying to say\r\nerenlaiii (programming):
    Oh it butchered a Hokkien phrase I use a lot\r\nerenlaiii (programming): See
    jen na means bad kid and I guess speech to text had a bit of an aneurysm\r\nerenlaiii
    (programming): One of the many hazards of being dyslexic\r\nrosygoldart (art):
    kind of a small hazard dont ya think\r\nrosygoldart (art): its funny though\r\nrosygoldart
    (art): see you not mooncake\r\nKentoWrites (narrative/puzzles): See you not,
    Mooncake. \r\nerenlaiii (programming): Oh for fuck\u2019s sake\r"
