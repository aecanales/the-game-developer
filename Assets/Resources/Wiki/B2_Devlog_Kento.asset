  Title: ambition.
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "I was pleasantly surprised by our midterm feedback. I expected to comb
    through a rats nest of surface level criticism, which is what I\u2019ve come
    to expect from faculty. But the response was actually quite positive, if not
    terribly substantive. The thrust of their suggestion was \u201CDon\u2019t be
    too ambitious.\u201D (I think that was the quote.) Which is deeply unhelpful
    feedback for a narrative game.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s consider what an unambitious
    game narrative looks like. In the best case scenario, we\u2019d have a genre
    pastiche of a piece of nerd ephemera - Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dawn of
    the Dead, etc. - in the form of a movie with gameplay begrudgingly attached to
    it. (A movie with terrible production quality given we\u2019re a team of three
    to boot.) \r\n\r\nAmbition is all we have. If our game doesn\u2019t stand out,
    if it doesn\u2019t command attention, it won\u2019t get any. What else can that
    feedback accomplish besides engendering mediocrity? The acceptance of mediocrity
    is why I never work with teams on any project with a complex story. Games are
    a medium in which not having a story is preferable to a perfunctory one, because
    then at least the gameplay goes uninterrupted. I\u2019ve lost track of how many
    times I tried to explain that to my last team. But I think maybe Eren gets it,
    which is a nice surprise.\r\n\r\nThough to be honest I find myself disagreeing
    with Rose\u2019s perspective on the issue. We\u2019re having a productive semester:
    the <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> is nearly done - all her <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    are in place and only the <mark=#ffff00aa>Minotaur</mark> remains unfinished.
    And she\u2019s already talking about <mark=#ffff00aa>burnout</mark>. Not even
    half a year into a project.\r\n\r\nThe positive feedback we\u2019ve received
    so far is contingent upon the pace we\u2019re keeping. The \u201Clost sleep\u201D
    she\u2019s trying to prevent is the very thing that allowed us to get this far.
    I don\u2019t know how to explain to her that this is just what it means to make
    art under capitalism. She\u2019s smart enough to know that and she\u2019s done
    good work so far. I have faith that she\u2019ll come to see things my way.\r\n\r"
