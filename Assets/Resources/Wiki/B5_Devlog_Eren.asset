  Title: 'Re: visual bug'
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "So we\u2019ve run into a major visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>. There\u2019s
    lots of artifacting and flashing that makes the game pretty much unviewable (and
    unplayable), and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing it. It doesn\u2019t show
    up on everyone\u2019s computers (Kento hasn\u2019t had any issues, but me and
    Rose haven\u2019t been as lucky), so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s because of the
    new Toonity engine update? \n\nI managed to put together a quick fix since I
    haven\u2019t been able to find anyone talking about it online. Kento was really
    pushing me to fix the bug fast so all the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark> features
    could be done for our midterm build though. I set one of the visual parameters
    to 0 on the skybox to turn the flashing off for now, but we\u2019ll have to actually
    deal with it at some point. \n\r\nI\u2019ve also been regularly getting <mark=#ffff00aa>headaches</mark>
    while in the coworking space between classes. I think it\u2019s because the lights
    there are super bright? I\u2019ve been avoiding that area and pushing through
    cause I really want this project to be a success. I know I initially was only
    invested for Kento\u2019s sake, but I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s grown on me and
    now it\u2019s sort of my baby as well.\n\r\nSuper excited to show this to a wider
    audience at <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark>! I should check in with Rose about that.
    \r\n"
