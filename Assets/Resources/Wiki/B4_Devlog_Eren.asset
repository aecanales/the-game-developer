  Title: Starting Strong
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "We hit the ground running pretty much immediately after getting back
    from break. Though Kento didn\u2019t seem to have taken a break at all. He was
    actually kind of upset that Rose didn\u2019t do the same. \n\r\nWell, she kind
    of did, actually. That new 3D modeling technique she tried out over break is
    gonna make implementing her models a lot easier - I just think Kento is a little
    miffed that she didn\u2019t apply it to our game first. I totally get why she
    didn\u2019t do that, but I would have been more than willing to help her out\u2026
    Oh well. I\u2019m just glad that our workflows are all a little easier now. \r\n\r\nI
    should probably talk about what I\u2019ve been working on\u2026 Kento wants me
    to implement a more finished version of the <indent=5%>arena</mark> so he can
    mess around in the engine and figure out things like mechanics, tone, and lighting
    conditions. Rose is still hard at work on the final <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    for both the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> and the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>,
    but her <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark> are structured in such a way that I\u2019m
    able to use previous ones for the <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> as placeholders.
    I should thank her for her foresight. There was also an update to the engine
    last month that did break a few things on the backend but I managed to get them
    sorted out pretty quick. \r\n\r\nClover also mentioned that we could submit our
    midterm progress to <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC\u2019s</mark> indie showcase! The <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark>
    level by itself more than meets the requirement that builds are playable for
    at least 5 minutes or more, and we can definitely set aside a week or so to make
    some preliminary promo stuff. We\u2019ve set up a checklist of things we want
    to have in the game by the submission deadline in mid-March (Kento and Rose argued
    a little about the details but that\u2019s to be expected), and Rose will be
    handling the submission form since she\u2019s done this before. \n\r\nI\u2019m
    super excited for more people to see our game! \r"
