  Content: "- once again, kento is putting his precious project and his ego above
    his supposed best friend\u2019s <mark=#ffff00aa>health</mark> and wellbeing\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i\u2019ve been telling him that i\u2019ve been overextending for MONTHS. not
    a shred of sympathy or understanding from him about wanting to fix the visual
    <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark> before we dig ourselves any deeper into the hole\r\n-
    but now he actually gives a shit after eren ends up in the hospital? </indent>\r\n-
    i said we should all take this as a sign to take a step back from the project
    but of course kento saw it as an attack on his baby\r\n<indent=5%>- let him destroy
    his health if he\u2019s so desperate for outside approval then. see if i give
    a shit after what you\u2019ve done to your closest friend</indent>\r\n- i really
    am getting no <mark=#ffff00aa>enjoyment</mark> from not working on this. i\u2019ve
    grown to love this world. i just wish that kento would take off his blinders
    and start thinking about how his actions keep dragging us all down\r"
