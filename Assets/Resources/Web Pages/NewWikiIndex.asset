    Title: First Devlog - Kento
    Subtitle: Why does magic grace the world? Because I once looked up at the stars
      and dreamed it was real.
    Content: "I\u2019m thrilled to be working on this for Thesis. Initially Eren
      and I started it as a passion project, not really expecting anything to come
      of it, but now we have a whole year to work on it as much as we can. I\u2019m
      aiming to have this published eventually, so we have to take this seriously.\r\nWe
      had our first meeting with our advisor Clover earlier this week. They seemed
      to be on board with the idea and even gave us a few jumping-off points for
      us to consider. Their main concern, however, was the lack of visual design
      and art in both our combined skill sets. I didn\u2019t think it was that big
      of an issue, but they suggested we look for collaborators within our cohort
      of classmates. \r\nThat aside, I\u2019ll need to detail everything about my
      vision for the game if we\u2019re to bring someone else onboard. Eren gets
      what I mean all the time, but other people might not. It\u2019s crucially important
      that we\u2019re all in agreement about the project. \r\nCurrently, The Last
      Sorcerer is a game about a sorcerer who is, predictably, the last of their
      kind - magic has disappeared from the world due to the hubris of man and it
      is his duty to bring it back. I intend for it to be an experience with little
      to no guidance, so that the player is encouraged to experiment and explore.
      A type of sandbox, if you will. \r\nI\u2019ll be working on the puzzles and
      story for the game, and Eren will be handling the programming. I suppose our
      third collaborator will make all the visual assets. \r\nI\u2019ve also decided
      to set up a wiki for our development process. We can upload builds and devlogs
      to it, and I think Eren can set our group chat to autoupload conversations
      as well; it\u2019ll be good to have a record of all of this to look back onto
      if need be. Eren said we can use his private server to host it as well. \r"

    Title: Eren's Devlog #0
    Subtitle: "Can\u2019t wait to finally get to work on this in class! (\u2312\u25BD\u2312)\u2606"
    Content: "I really didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get this far on The Last Sorcerer,
      honestly. Kento and me started it for fun and now it\u2019s like a whole long-term
      project! Funny how these things work, sometimes.\r\nOur advisor did suggest
      we look into getting someone with more visual experience onto the project.
      To Kento\u2019s chagrin. Idk tho, I think it\u2019s a great idea. There\u2019s
      no guarantee that we\u2019ll have the funds or connections to commission an
      artist willing to endure Kento\u2019s vision, and developing visuals alongside
      the rest of the project is probably a much better use of our time anyway. \r\nMaybe
      Rose would be down to join us? (\xB4\uFF61\u2022 \u03C9 \u2022\uFF61`)\r\nShe
      did show a lot of interest during our initial presentation last week. She\u2019s
      also got quite a few games under her belt already, and that experience will
      be invaluable since we want to have this published eventually. I\u2019ll run
      it by her next week and see what she thinks. (\xB4 \u2200 ` *)\r\nWe also have
      a new wiki to track our progress in! (\u272F\u25E1\u272F)\r\nI\u2019m posting
      this devlog directly there, and I\u2019ll upload our progress builds and chat
      logs as well. I had to clear some stuff off my private server for the partition,
      but it was all random old stuff anyway.. \r\nThat aside, now I have to clean
      up the file structure of the project since I probably won\u2019t be the only
      person working on the code\u2026 \xAF\\_| \u2716 \u301C \u2716 |_/\xAF\r"

    Title: Second Devlog - Kento
    Subtitle: 'Why does magic grace the world? Because I imagined the stars and the
      universe in the palm of my hand, and grasped them tight before they flew away. '
    Content: "Following our advisor\u2019s advice, we\u2019ve decided to add Rose
      to our team as an artist. Welcome aboard, Rose. \r\nI finally got to bring
      out the lore document after a long while - Eren knows pretty much everything
      about what I envision the story to be, so it was nice to be able to describe
      it all to someone else. She seemed to absorb most of it, which is good. So
      far all three of us are still on the same page regarding the game\u2019s direction.
      \r\nSince then, I\u2019ve expanded on the religious belief system of The Last
      Sorcerer some more - namely, the catalyst for why magic disappeared from the
      land in the first place. I\u2019ve decided to convey this through adding two
      main gods to the world: I imagine their names to correspond to their way of
      thinking. Nostralia (who represents the past) looks endlessly to days gone
      by, while Reyalita (representing the future) does nothing but consider what
      is to come. The conflict between them is what caused magic to disappear from
      the land, and is also what keeps it from returning. The \u201Clast sorcerer\u201D
      will probably be involved in some way, and will ultimately convince them to
      reconcile and help magic return to the land. \r\nThat aside, we did talk about
      how the mechanics of this narrative would be implemented as well. Rose mentioned
      that a more modular system of casting magic, wherein the player is able to
      choose different components and combine them in different ways to create spells,
      would be both simpler to understand and easier to implement. I still prefer
      my own esoteric system, as I feel it conveys the narrative much better, but
      Eren convinced me to try and give it a shot at least. I suppose that\u2019s
      what he and I will be working on for the next while. \r"

    Title: Eren's Devlog #1
    Subtitle: "We\u2019ve added Rose to our team! (\u2312\u25BD\u2312)\u2606"
    Content: "\rRose willl be handling all of the art and other visual design stuff
      like the UI. Like I said in my last log, her prior experience with gamedev
      will also help us out tremendously - me and Kento are still pretty new to this,
      after all. I\u2019m hoping to pick her brain on the programming and implementation
      side of things; she might not be programming for this game, but she\u2019s
      done some really neat stuff in the past. ( \u02D9\u25BF\u02D9 )\r\nOne big
      thing Rose brought up at our last meeting was that Kento\u2019s (still currently
      theoretical) system for magic would probably benefit from being modularized
      into two parts. Is modularized a word? I don\u2019t know. (\u201E\u2022 \u058A
      \u2022\u201E) Anyways. \r\nIt took some convincing to get Kento to give it
      a shot, but I think he\u2019s coming around. He gets\u2026 very stuck in his
      own ways sometimes (classic Kento!). After all, I wasn\u2019t able to get his
      previous ideas working in-engine to a point where he was happy with it. \r\nRose\u2019s
      modular system idea will definitely be a lot more straightforward to implement,
      and I actually already have a good chunk of it done already. It\u2019s still
      all placeholder sprites and there are a few bugs for me to iron out, but the
      spell combination system works and I\u2019m able to trigger different effects
      on the enemies based on the component parts of said spells. +\uFF61\uFF9F\u03C6(\u309D\u03C9\u30FB\uFF40\u25CB)+\uFF61\uFF9F\r\n\rAll
      in all, we\u2019re on a pretty good track, I think. At least with more of a
      distributed workload we won\u2019t all get overwhelmed with work now\u2026

    Content: "- got onboarded by eren and kento, can\u2019t wait to start work on
      this :) \r\n- kento gave me a pretty big lore dump about the narrative and
      his vision for the game during our first meeting \r\n<indent=2%>- overall it\u2019s
      a pretty solid vision, but it kind of gets bogged down by a lot of very specific
      and complicated mechanics</indent>\r\n- suggested last week that we use a more
      modular system for casting magic \r\n<indent=2%>- 2 parts</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-
      shape: the form the spell takes (fireball, gust of wind, etc)</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-
      effect: what the spell does (light things on fire, blow them away, freeze them,
      etc)</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>- lots more potential for player creativity + interesting
      effects</indent>\r\n- kento seemed to balk at the idea but eren convinced him
      to at least give it a shot\r\n- in the meantime i\u2019ve been working on updating
      the game\u2019s assets from placeholders to actual spritework\r\n<indent=2%>-
      have most of the sorcerer sprites and animations done, working on a boss sprite/anims
      as well as the UI for the modular magic system i suggested</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-the
      UI is still pretty rudimentary, but we can playtest and refine as we go along</indent>\r\n-
      also started a github for version control, because apparently eren has just
      been working from his laptop without any backups. yikes\r\n<indent=2%>- kento

    Title: Third Devlog - Kento
    Subtitle: Why does magic grace the world? Because I toiled to make it so.
    Content: "Our midsemester progress deadline is coming up, and it\u2019s crucial
      that we really wow our advisor and the rest of the professors for it. It\u2019s
      our big chance to show everyone that The Last Sorcerer isn\u2019t just any
      old game. \r\nAs such, I\u2019m planning for us to have the maze level finished
      by next week. The modular magic system has been working really well, and we\u2019ve
      decided to transition over to using it as our main gameplay mechanic. Currently,
      we have a small but solid number of both spell shapes and spell effects, as
      well as valid outputs for all possible combinations. I\u2019ve been making
      great progress on the narrative as well, and plan to have a voiceover recorded
      for the deadline. \r\nRose has been trying to push back on the big build, though.
      I don\u2019t see the issue - she\u2019s been making good progress on updating
      all our assets, and it\u2019s work she\u2019ll need to do anyway. Why delay
      it when we can put it in now? Besides, I decided to capitulate and implement
      her modular magic idea. This team is a two-way street, after all. \r\nI did
      manage to get through to her in the end, so all\u2019s well that ends well.
      Our advisor is super on board with the idea too, and I\u2019m excited to knock
      his socks off. \r"

    Subtitle: "Mid-semester deadline next week! \u0669(\u25D5\u203F\u25D5\uFF61)\u06F6"
    Content: "I\u2019ve been implementing everything that Kento and Rose have been
      coming up with into our latest build of the maze level, as well as programming
      all the intricacies of the player\u2019s movement (dashing, dodging, etc) and
      it\u2019s shaping up to be a really cool experience so far. (\u272F\u25E1\u272F)
      Kento\u2019s transformed Rose\u2019s modular magic concept into a whole intricate
      system, and after grumbling about it to me for a good lil\u2019 bit, I think
      he\u2019s come around and grown to really like it.\r\nBuuut, that does bring
      me to programming the boss\u2019s attacks.  I could program it just fine with
      the placeholder asset we\u2019ve been using, but I won\u2019t know the timings
      of the animations Rose is using on the actual sprite until she\u2019s finished
      with them, and I would likely have to redo all my programming work. We talked
      about that during our last meeting, but that caused Kento and Rose to get into
      a big argument (which I still feel really bad about). (U \u2022\u0301 .\u032B
      \u2022\u0300 U)\r\nIt really won\u2019t take me that long to implement all
      the assets once Rose is finished with them, but I\u2019m a little worried about
      Kento\u2019s pushiness. I don\u2019t really mind it since I\u2019m usually
      happy to help him out, but Rose isn\u2019t used to the way Kento works, and
      neither of them seem willing to change how they do things\u2026 I hope it doesn\u2019t
      blow up into a full-fledged fight. \r\n\r\n<i>Addendum 10/19:</i> I happened
      to overhear one of Kento\u2019s conversations with our advisor, who was worried
      that we\u2019re overscoping for the mid-semester deadline. Our advisor thought
      we\u2019re doing too much, especially with the art, but Kento reassured him
      that Rose was doing alright. It\u2019s a little unlike Kento to be so in-touch
      with Rose\u2019s workflow, especially since they\u2019ve been fighting,  but
      I guess they talked about it outside the meeting because Rose has been slowly
      working away at the necessary assets in the meantime. \r\nI\u2019m just glad
      everything turned out okay. ( \u02D9\u25BF\u02D9 )\r"
