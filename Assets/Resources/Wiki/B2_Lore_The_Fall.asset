  Title: The Fall
  Subtitle: Lore
  Content: "The remaining two sages, seeing the destruction a single selfish act
    had wrought on the kingdom and its inhabitants, decided that the sorcerer had
    grown too complacent in his magical ability to fear the rightfully forbidden.
    They punished him by sealing him into a vast maze at the southern end of the
    kingdom, as his powers had grown far too much for him to be killed without further
    magical backlash. \n\r\nUnfortunately, even this was not enough to keep him fully
    sealed. The two sages eventually realized that the sorcerer\u2019s magic was
    leaking into the area surrounding the maze, and were forced to suspend the entire
    old kingdom\u2019s lands into stasis to prevent further catastrophe. \n\r\nThis
    resulted in a near total purge of all remaining magic from the kingdom, as all
    of it had to be continually siphoned into maintaining the land\u2019s stasis
    and the barrier surrounding it. \n\r\nThe sages saw this as an acceptable loss,
    since they felt that humanity was abusing their gift. Unfortunately, since they
    had grown to sustain themselves off of people\u2019s worship of them, their power
    eventually began to fade. \r\nDue to the weakening of the seals on the maze,
    the last sorcerer eventually awakens, kicking off the plot of the game.\r\n"
