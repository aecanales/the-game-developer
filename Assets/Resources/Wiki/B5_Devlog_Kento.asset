  Title: You have GOT to be fukcing kiddingff me
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Rose \u201Cforgot\u201D to submit our game to <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark>.
    She \u201CFORGOT.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou forget to lock the door on your way to work.
    You forget to take out the trash. You forget a menial task. You NEGLECT a responsibility.
    God is punishing me; he put my own fucking father on my team.\r\n\r\nI just spent
    my whole week penning dialogue for bosses, NPCs, and mobs, writing extensive
    plot outlines. Now I\u2019m starting to doubt any of that work will see the light
    of day. Our advisor has once again blessed us with their sage advice: our story
    should probably have an <mark=#ffff00aa>ending</mark>. Shit, why didn\u2019t
    I think of that? Here I was planning to leave the fucking thing unfinished! \r\n\r\nI
    wish she would stop rushing me; I haven\u2019t settled on an <mark=#ffff00aa>ending</mark>
    yet because this is (theoretically) a shared vision and I want us to collaborate.
    I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll even have time, because the rest of the production
    pipeline isn\u2019t moving very fast. Eren and Rose can\u2019t (or won\u2019t)
    set aside their main roles to be co-writers. Just this past week a visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>
    forced Rose to redo nearly every <mark=#ffff00aa>Arena</mark> asset. And because
    of that we didn\u2019t manage to get it into the midterm showcase build.\r\n\r\nThis
    is what crunching is for. If Rose was willing to lose as much sleep as I have,
    the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark> would have made that deadline. We\u2019re a
    small team on a non-existent budget working on a tight schedule. We crunch or
    we fail. I guess the others prefer comfort over success. That\u2019s their right,
    but the industry is going to crush them.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should just throw together
    some god-forsaken pseudo-finale to placate our advisor. Later though, writing
    from anger has never turned out well for me.\r"
