  Content: "Sisyphus Moment: Don\u2019t think I don't know what you\u2019re up to,
    Rose. \r\nSisyphus Moment: First you tell me that you\u2019re so wildly out of
    touch with industry norms that you aren\u2019t willing to put in the hours for
    this game and lose some sleep.\r\nSisyphus Moment: Forgive me for being skeptical
    of the idea that you\u2019ve been doing this for years. \r\nSisyphus Moment:
    On top of all of that, we only find out that you \u201Cforgot\u201D to submit
    our work to the <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark> indie showcase when we talk to Clover
    during our advising meeting?\r\ntoonity update anti: kento i promise i didnt
    do it on purpose i genuinely forgot\r\ntoonity update anti: you guys know my
    memory is really bad\r\ntoonity update anti: i mixed it up with the tax filing
    deadline for this year bc the numbers are reversed\r\ntoonity update anti: 13th
    and 31st\r\nSisyphus Moment: After all you\u2019ve been saying about not wanting
    to put my hard work in the Black <mark=#ffff00aa>Tortoise build</mark> because
    it\u2019s not as polished as you want it to be for your precious portfolio? And
    you expect me to believe you didn\u2019t do it on purpose?\r\nSisyphus Moment:
    For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t you at least WRITE THINGS DOWN?\r\nFlashing Lights
    Warning: Kento being overly accusatory isn\u2019t gonna help us with anything
    please stop\r\ntoonity update anti: oh is this what we\u2019re doing now? saying
    stuff you\u2019d never say to my face over text? hiding behind your little computer
    screen? \r\ntoonity update anti: and for your information if writing things down
    worked for me i would have fucking done it by now! \r\nSisyphus Moment: Well,
    how am I supposed to feel about you sabotaging the biggest opportunity we\u2019ve
    ever had to get our game out into the world?\r\nSisyphus Moment: Eren, don\u2019t
    tell me you\u2019re on her side now. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Kento please
    I\u2019m not taking sides I just want us to be objective about this \r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: The 13th and 31st are very similar dates and I can see how Rose
    would have mixed them up if they both had important deadlines tied to them \r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: Raking her over the coals is only going to make things worse\r\nFlashing
    Lights Warning: We\u2019re still a team and we can work this out without calling
    each other names\r\ntoonity update anti: ugh fine i promise you this won\u2019t
    happen again \r\nSisyphus Moment: That\u2019s what my parents would always say
    to me every time they forgot something that was important to me. \r\nSisyphus
    Moment: Every single birthday. Every single milestone and award. \r\nSisyphus
    Moment: They didn\u2019t even bother coming to my high school graduation because
    they \u201Cforgot\u201D my brother\u2019s stupid 6th grade award ceremony was
    on the same day. \r\nSisyphus Moment: Every time they would say the same thing.
    \u201CI\u2019m so sorry I forgot. I promise this won\u2019t happen again.\u201D\r\nSisyphus
    Moment: But it always did, so why should I believe you? \r\ntoonity update anti:
    kento i am NOT your parents why the fuck are you comparing me to them? \r\ntoonity
    update anti: i had nothing to do with your emo boy villain origin story leave
    me out of it \r\nSisyphus Moment: And yet you\u2019ve done the same thing they\u2019ve
    always done. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Rose that\u2019s not fair and you know
    it\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Kento, shaming her for forgetting an optional
    deadline isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere \r\nSisyphus Moment: \u201COptional\u201D?
    Eren, don\u2019t pretend you aren\u2019t disappointed in her as well. Clearly
    no one\u2019s ever told her that her \u201Clittle mistakes\u201D have consequences,
    so I will.\r\ntoonity update anti: you think you\u2019re the only one out there
    who acts like forgetting things and murder are on the same level? \r\ntoonity
    update anti: you think i wasn\u2019t constantly told as a child that something
    i genuinely struggled with was only happening bc i was just lazy and didn\u2019t
    want to do things and just needed to apply myself more? \r\nSisyphus Moment:
    Oh, quit it with the crocodile tears. People like you are always the same. You
    all use forgetfulness as an excuse because you just don\u2019t care.\r\ntoonity
    update anti: kento you shut your bastard mouth right now. \r\ntoonity update
    anti: dont you DARE tell me that something that\u2019s been plaguing me all my
    life is a silly little excuse i use to get out of doing things \r\nFlashing Lights
    Warning: Both of you, that\u2019s ENOUGH. \r\ntoonity update anti: kento dont
    be running your mouth any longer i know where you li\r\n[toonity update anti
    has been placed in timeout by Flashing Lights Warning.]\r\n[Sisyphus Moment has
    been placed in timeout by Flashing Lights Warning.]\r\nFlashing Lights Warning:
    Both of you are going to turn off your phones, calm down, and sleep this off.
    \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: We\u2019ll address this properly tomorrow. \r"
