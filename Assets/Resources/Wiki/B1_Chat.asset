  Content: "Kento: good meeting! what did you guys think\r\nRose: im so glad that
    the modular magic idea meshed so well with what you brought in at the start of
    the year\r\nRose: i really didnt think itd work that well\r\nEren: Even our advisor
    Clover was shocked, I think. Rare to see that on her. \r\nRose:yea i think the
    only other time ive seen her like that was when the dept chair covered everything
    in her office in tinfoil for april fools\r\nKento: i would hope that \u201Cpleasantly
    shocked\u201D and \u201Cwhat the fuck is happening\u201D look markedly different
    on her\u2026\r\nRose: cmon you know what i mean\r\nRose: like\r\nRose: shes always
    so chill and cool\r\nRose: we rarely see her facade crack\r\nEren: Yeah, it was
    nice to see her emote a little more than she normally does, haha. \r\nEren: But
    back to business. \r\nEren: Clover said they wanted to see a little more from
    the modular magic idea by our midterm check-in, so we should definitely make
    that one of our top priorities. \r\nKento: don\u2019t forget the overall narrative
    skeleton too! \r\nKento: that\u2019s one of the most important parts of the game\r\nEren:
    Oh, yeah, of course. \r\nRose: i think clovers just having a bit of a hard time
    imagining whats in ur head lol\r\nKento: well where else would it be? \r\nRose:
    on paper somewhere? \r\nRose: kinda hard for people to read ur mind and figure
    out what ur cooking for the game\r\nEren: Rose is right, Kento. I think a brain
    dump would help to just get everything out of your head? \r\nEren: It doesn\u2019t
    need to be neat, just accessible to others. \r\nKento: i mean i guess i can give
    it a shot\r\nKento: you know i\u2019ve never done anything like this before eren\r\nRose:
    wait fr\r\nRose: i totally thought you would be the kind of lore guy with like
    30000 google docs \r\nEren: This\u2019ll be a fruitful semester, I think! \r\nEren:
    When did you guys want to meet oh hello there Mooncake. Can I help you? Oh ow
    don\u2019t do that. See you not. \r\nRose: huh whuh\r\nKento: oh mooncake probably
    walked in while he was in the middle of speech to text\r\nKento: happens all
    the time\r\nRose: ohhhh\r\nEren: Sorry about that. The child is now contained.
    \r\nRose: i demand pictures of the child\r\nEren: Attachment (mooncake.png)\r\nRose:
    OH MY GOD\r\nKento: ah, mischievous as ever \r\nRose: ok but howd the speech
    to text end up with see you not lmao\r\nRose: what were you trying to say\r\nEren:
    Oh, it butchered a Hokkien phrase I use a lot. \r\nEren: \u201CSee jen na\u201D
    means \u201Cbad kid\u201D, and I guess speech to text had a bit of an aneurysm.
    \r\nEren: One of the many hazards of being dyslexic.\r\nRose: its funny though\r\nRose:
    see you not mooncake\r\nKento: see you not mooncake\r\nEren: Oh, for fuck\u2019s
    sake. \r"
