  Title: ambition.

  Content: "we just got our midterm feedback for trismegistus, and i\u2019m really
    glad that everyone seemed to like it. i don\u2019t mention this often to others,
    but this is the first time i\u2019m letting others work on one of my more complex
    stories, so i was rather nervous about what people would think\n\r\neven though
    i suppose my fears were mostly unfounded, the faculty\u2019s main piece of advice
    for us was that i might be\u2026 what was the exact quote? \u201Cbeing a little
    too ambitious\u201D? i don\u2019t believe there can be such a thing when it comes
    to narratives. game narratives have always been the most overlooked part of development,
    after all\n\r\nspeaking of particulars, we managed to have the maze level\u2019s
    design and puzzles finalized and fully implemented with assets from rose for
    the midterm. the minotaur boss fight was also functional - it still needs the
    bells and whistles that will really sell the battle, but the player was able
    to fight them\n\r\nin my perspective, things went pretty well for our first major
    deadline, but to be honest i\u2019m a little concerned by rose already saying
    she wants to try and counter burnout. after all, it\u2019s only been two months,
    and sometimes you just have to get things done. if it means you lose a little
    sleep over it, then to me it\u2019s a small price to pay \n\r\nour advisor seemed
    to be of the same mind, because they said we should keep going at our current
    pace. if it\u2019s too much, we can always step back and reassess next semester
    - eren seems to be on board as well. i\u2019m sure rose will come around \r"
