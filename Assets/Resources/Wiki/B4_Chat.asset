    Down Your Kitchen: rose why are you named after the panera charged lemonade?
    \r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: also didn\u2019t you take that game off your itch\r\npanera
    rose refresher: yeah didnt i tell you guys? i put it back after my experiment
    \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: I don\u2019t think Panera ever had a
    rose flavored lemonade? \r\npanera rose refresher: the one i went to at the time
    did\r\npanera rose refresher: great for allnighters! not great for your wallet\r\npanera
    rose refresher: or heart. theres way too much caffeine in those things \r\nMooncake\u2019s
    Indentured Servant: Oh man. \r\npanera rose refresher: it was really good though
    i miss it kinda \r\npanera rose refresher: that was in my grindset era though
    im a changed woman \r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: why would you not want to be
    in your grindset era? seems like a good attitude to have towards your work\r\npanera
    rose refresher: oh yknow\r\npanera rose refresher: id lose track of time for
    hours\r\npanera rose refresher: go into a fugue state and then be holding some
    absurd unrelated creation when i came out of it\r\npanera rose refresher: not
    great when you have deadlines\r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: idk that sounds pretty
    nice though?\r\npanera rose refresher: of course youd think so \r\npanera rose
    refresher: hang on\r\n[KentoWrites\u2019 display name has been changed to Kento
    \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox]\r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: HEY\r\npanera
    rose refresher: am i wrong tho\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: I think
    we\u2019re getting kind of off topic here. We were gonna talk about what we need
    in our midterm and DGC builds? \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: right
    right. \r\npanera rose refresher: sorry lmfao \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured
    Servant: We have the maze done, so that\u2019ll definitely be part of it. \r\nMooncake\u2019s
    Indentured Servant: I should have the frontier fully implemented before our midterm
    deadline as long as I get the asset and puzzle stuff from you guys. \r\nMooncake\u2019s
    Indentured Servant: How is that looking on your ends? \r\npanera rose refresher:
    frontier assets are on track to be finished mid february\r\npanera rose refresher:
    how much lead time do you need \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: the
    frontier tiles puzzle is 80% complete, just needs some more playtesting and a
    couple bugs ironed out \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: the arena will
    be added as long as we finish the assets for them in time\r\nMooncake\u2019s
    Indentured Servant: Give me at least a week and a half? Our midterm deadline
    is March 17, so I\u2019d need everything by March 7 or 8 at the latest. \r\npanera
    rose refresher: sure thing boss\r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: i should
    have the puzzles and the narrative for the frontier done by then, yeah \r\nKento
    \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: i don\u2019t have any NPCs planned bc i want
    to create that abandoned wasteland vibe \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant:
    Sure thing. Maybe one or two max, if we need them? \r\npanera rose refresher:
    yeah playtesting will probably tell us we need em lol\r\npanera rose refresher:
    im a little worried about how much polish well be able to get on the dgc build
    though \r\npanera rose refresher: the arena can go in the midterm build but id
    rather take it out of the dgc one \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: well
    DGC is an industry event right? they\u2019ll understand if some things are a
    little rougher\r\npanera rose refresher: yeah but there\u2019s gonna be a lot
    of publishers and professionals at this INDUSTRY EVENT\r\npanera rose refresher:
    we have to have something at least presentable for them bc we could all have
    job opportunities riding on it \r\npanera rose refresher: and i can either focus
    on the frontier assets or the arena assets for the midterm. not both \r\nKento
    \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: well would it be workable to do both if you put
    in a few all nighters? i really want this build to have the arena content\r\nKento
    \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: it\u2019s a pretty crucial part of the story
    that the sorcerer visits the sages \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: Whoa,
    guys, I don\u2019t think we need to be pulling all nighters for this! \r\npanera
    rose refresher: look kento ive said this already but ill say it again since you
    seem to have forgotten\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: This is all work
    we have to do eventually - if we can\u2019t get all of it done in time for the
    deadline, that\u2019s okay. \r\npanera rose refresher: i am not pulling any more
    all nighters for this project. \r\npanera rose refresher: if you want to wreck
    your health and your sleep schedule be my fucking guest\r\npanera rose refresher:
    but i will not sacrifice my health and the presentability of this game just because
    you want your story to be more complete or whatever \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D
    Cox: wow, so eager to crush my vision, are you? \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D
    Cox: you\u2019re just like my mother \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant:
    Kento\u2026\r\npanera rose refresher: oh am i? you could probably stand to learn
    a thing or two from her then \r\nKento \u201CSigma Grindset\u201D Cox: .\r\npanera
    rose refresher: i\u2019ll get the game registered with dgc while you decide what
    you really want out of this deadline\r\n"
