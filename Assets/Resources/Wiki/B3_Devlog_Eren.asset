  Title: Crunch and compromise
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- Playtest problem number one: People keep killing the old man\r\n- So
    I renamed him to \u201Cadorable dog\u201D\r\n- Something tells me even that won\u2019t
    stop these players though\r\n- Playtests are nice because we get a lot of good
    feedback but also not so good because that means I have so many random little
    fixes to keep track of\r\n- We found this other weird <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>
    where if you walk into a specific corner of the maze, the whole game crashes\r\n-
    But after I\u2019m done fixing things like that, we should be just about done
    with the <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur</mark> boss fight. And I gotta say that\u2019s
    gonna feel great\r\n- It means we can start thinking about the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    level Kento keeps talking about for next semester. He\u2019s got big plans for
    it and I just know he\u2019s gonna have a bunch of stuff for me to do when I
    get back from break\r\n- About Kento though\r\n- He and Rose keep having disagreements\r\n-
    I\u2019m not going to call it fighting, but just like very tense moments talking
    about crunch and burnout and work load and stuff\r\n- Rose is pretty chill which
    I like. She keeps talking about this game she made called Last Night. No it\u2019s
    Last <mark=#ffff00aa>Knight</mark> with a K\r\n- Anyways she was only able to
    finish because she crunched really hard and it ended up being really bad\r\n-
    I went and played it and it\u2019s actually like really good? I could kinda see
    what she meant though\r\n- Anyway, Rose keeps warning us about burnout and wants
    to uh how did she say it? Underpromise and overdeliver\r\n- But Kento is not
    like that at all. Kento was born to hustle. Burnout is afraid of him \r\n- I
    bet he would say something edgy like \u201Call great art is borne in blood\u201D
    or something like that. \u201CArt is life and life is suffering so suffering
    is art\u201D \r\n- You get the idea \r\n- I had them both talk to Clover about
    it and they seem to have come to a mutual understanding? Question mark? I hope
    slash think so?\r\n- I was also worried that Kento would get weird about letting
    other people work on his precious narratives even if they\u2019re not doing writing
    stuff but he\u2019s taking it really well so far. - It\u2019s a happy surprise\r\n"
