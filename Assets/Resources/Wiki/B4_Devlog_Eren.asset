  Title: Eren's Devlog #4
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Was conflicted about going behind Rose\u2019s back to put Kento\u2019s
    ideas in the game\r\n\tHe understood where Kento was coming from, but didn\u2019t
    feel comfortable going behind Rose\u2019s back to help him\r\n\tRelieved that
    Kento was willing to hear him out and follow his advice bc a team doesn\u2019t
    hide things from each other \r\nTalks about what he implemented + a couple of
    bugs\r\n\tStarted implementing the arena combat in an actual arena instead of
    a greybox (though he used it as reference)\r\n\tComments that Rose\u2019s assets
    are really well made in a such a way that allows them to be repurposed/tweaked
    very easily (mental reminder to thank her later)\r\n\tMentions that an update
    did break a few things on the engine backend but he managed to get them sorted
    out\r\n"
