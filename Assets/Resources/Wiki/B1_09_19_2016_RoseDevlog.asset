  Content: "- got onboarded by eren and kento, can\u2019t wait to start work on this
    :) \r\n- kento gave me a pretty big lore dump about the narrative and his vision
    for the game during our first meeting \r\n<indent=2%>- overall it\u2019s a pretty
    solid vision, but it kind of gets bogged down by a lot of very specific and complicated
    mechanics</indent>\r\n- suggested last week that we use a more modular system
    for casting magic \r\n<indent=2%>- 2 parts</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>- shape: the
    form the spell takes (fireball, gust of wind, etc)</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>- effect:
    what the spell does (light things on fire, blow them away, freeze them, etc)</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-
    lots more potential for player creativity + interesting effects</indent>\r\n-
    kento seemed to balk at the idea but eren convinced him to at least give it a
    shot\r\n- in the meantime i\u2019ve been working on updating the game\u2019s
    assets from placeholders to actual spritework\r\n<indent=2%>- have most of the
    sorcerer sprites and animations done, working on a boss sprite/anims as well
    as the UI for the modular magic system i suggested</indent>\r\n<indent=2%>-the
    UI is still pretty rudimentary, but we can playtest and refine as we go along</indent>\r\n-
    also started a github for version control, because apparently eren has just been
    working from his laptop without any backups. yikes\r\n<indent=2%>- kento wanted
    to use his fancy wiki, but eren said there probably wouldn\u2019t be enough space
    on his server for all the files</indent>\r"
