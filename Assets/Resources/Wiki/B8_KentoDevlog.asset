  Title: Kento's Devlog #8
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Kento goes on a rant about how they have to IMMEDIATELY fix this or their
    timeline for a Steam release will get messed up. Argues that Rose is sabotaging
    the project and doesn\u2019t want it to get done bc it\u2019s embarrassing (cites
    the DGC thing). Feels very betrayed by Eren \u201Csiding\u201D with Rose despite
    him acknowledging the effort it would take to get everything fixed\r"
