    menu boys\r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: Rose, why are you named after a Panera
    drink? \r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: Didn\u2019t you also take that game off
    your page?\r\npanera rose refresher: yeah didn't i tell you guys? i put it back
    after my experiment \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: I don\u2019t think
    Panera ever had a rose flavored lemonade\r\npanera rose refresher: the one i
    went to at the time did\r\npanera rose refresher: great for allnighters! not
    great for your wallet\r\npanera rose refresher: or heart. theres way too much

    rose refresher: it was really good though i miss it kinda \r\npanera rose refresher:
    that was in my hustle era though im a changed woman \r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen:
    Why would you ever not want to be in your hustle era? It seems like a good attitude
    to have towards your work. \r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen: You could do with some
    more motivation to get things done. The industry isn\u2019t going to stop just
    for you. \r\npanera rose refresher: oh really now Mister Hustle is that how it
    is\r\npanera rose refresher: for your information, Mister Hustle, id lose track
    of time for hours back then\r\npanera rose refresher: go into a fugue state and
    then be holding some absurd unrelated creation when i came out of it\r\npanera
    rose refresher: not great when you have deadlines\r\nBurning Down Your Kitchen:
    Can\u2019t you channel it into specific things? \r\npanera rose refresher: of
    course youd think i could do that\r\npanera rose refresher: hang on\r\n[Burning
    Down Your Kitchen\u2019s display name has been changed to Kento \u201CMister

    rose refresher: why are you booing me im right\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured
    Servant: I think we\u2019re getting kind of off topic here\r\nMooncake\u2019s
    Indentured Servant: We were gonna talk about what we need in our midterm and
    <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark> builds\r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: Right\r\npanera
    rose refresher: sorry lmfao \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: We have the
    <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> from last semester done so that\u2019ll definitely
    be part of it\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: I should have the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    fully implemented before our midterm deadline as long as I get the asset and
    puzzle stuff from you guys\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: How is that
    looking on your end\r\npanera rose refresher: <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    assets are on track to be finished mid february\r\npanera rose refresher: how
    much lead time do you need \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: The <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    tiles puzzle is 80% complete. It just needs some more playtesting and a couple
    of bugs to be resolved. \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: The <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    will be added as long as we finish the assets for them in time. Looking at you,
    Rose. \r\npanera rose refresher: bruh\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant:
    Give me at least a week and a half \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: Our
    midterm deadline is March 17 so I\u2019d need everything by March 7 or 8 at the
    latest\r\npanera rose refresher: sure thing boss\r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D
    Cox: I should have the puzzles and the narrative for the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    done by then. \r\npanera rose refresher: im a little worried about how much polish
    well be able to get on the <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark> build though \r\npanera
    rose refresher: the arena can go in the midterm build but id rather take it out
    of the <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark> one \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox:
    Well, DGC is an industry event right? They\u2019ll understand if some things
    are a little rougher. \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: We\u2019ll also
    be there to explain anything they\u2019re confused about. \r\npanera rose refresher:
    yeah but there\u2019s gonna be a lot of publishers and professionals at this
    INDUSTRY EVENT\r\npanera rose refresher: we have to have something at least presentable
    for them bc we could all have job opportunities riding on it \r\npanera rose
    refresher: it needs to be able to stand on its own somewhat\r\npanera rose refresher:
    and i can either focus on the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> assets or the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    assets for the midterm. not both \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: Would
    it be workable to do both if you put in a few all nighters? It\u2019s crucial
    that this build has the arena level. \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox:
    It\u2019s a very important portion of the narrative. \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured
    Servant: Whoa guys I don\u2019t think we need to be pulling all nighters for
    this\r\npanera rose refresher: look kento ive said this already but ill say it
    again since you seem to have forgotten\r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant:
    This is all work we have to do eventually \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant:
    If we can\u2019t get all of it done in time for the deadline that\u2019s okay\r\npanera
    rose refresher: i am not pulling any more all nighters for this project. \r\npanera
    rose refresher: if you want to wreck your health and your sleep schedule and
    burn yourself out over the pyre be my fucking guest\r\npanera rose refresher:
    but i will not sacrifice my health and the presentability of this game just because
    you want your story to be more complete or whatever \r\npanera rose refresher:
    its just a story it can come later\r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: So
    eager to crush my position and dismiss the power of the narrative that gives
    your art purpose, huh? \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: You\u2019re just
    like my mother. \r\nMooncake\u2019s Indentured Servant: Kento\u2026\r\npanera
    rose refresher: oh am i? you could probably stand to learn a thing or two from
    her then \r\nKento \u201CMister Hustle\u201D Cox: .\r\npanera rose refresher:
    i\u2019ll get the game registered with <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark> while you decide
    what you really want out of this deadline\r"
