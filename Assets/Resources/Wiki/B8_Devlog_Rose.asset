  Content: "- i TOLD kento that we should have dealt with that stupid <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark>
    when it first showed up\r\n<indent=5%>- but noooooo he insisted on ignoring it
    and using clumsy workarounds instead of figuring out how to properly avoid or
    fix it\r\n- wouldn\u2019t even give me the time to try my solution on one of
    the old test levels we had\r\n- i can\u2019t believe eren listened to him </indent>\r\n-
    but i\u2019m putting my foot down. either he gives me the flexibility i need
    to actually work on this without landing myself in the hospital from overwork,
    or i stop entirely for my <mark=#ffff00aa>health</mark>\r\n<indent=5%>- some
    days i just want to play minecraft when i come back from work but kento will
    bombard me with 50 thousand reminders to work on his game</indent>\r\n- i found
    myself referring to this as \u201Ckento\u2019s game\u201D the other day despite
    all the work i put into it, not to mention that the magic system was originally
    my idea\r\n<indent=5%>- that was not a fun realization to have. i do all the
    heavy lifting and he takes credit for it just because he's doing all the <mark=#ffff00aa>writing</mark>\r\n-
    just like my dad, bragging about my achievements like they never would have happened
    if not for his stupid guiding hand</indent>\r\n- and he has the nerve to call
    me a fucking micromanager? that\u2019s just salt in the wound\r"
