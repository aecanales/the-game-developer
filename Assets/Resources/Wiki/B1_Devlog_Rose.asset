  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Excitement to be working on a project with someone who\u2019s made really
    interesting narrative and puzzle stuff in the past \n\r\nPart admiration, part
    \u201Cwell I need to have a game made by a wider team in my portfolio and this
    seemed suitable\u201D \n\r\nTalks about how modular magic or modmagic system
    was actually an idea she\u2019d been turning over in her head for a while but
    didn\u2019t really have the design knowledge to implement herself\n\r\nWhen she
    grasped what Kento was trying to tell her about the narrative it clicked and
    she was like \u201Coh this\u2019ll be perfect\u201D \n\r\nSays she\u2019s started
    on concept art for the different characters and areas of the game, and talks
    about going to Playtest Tuesdays to show early builds\n\r\nKento seemed hesitant
    about doing so this early but she insisted that they can put together something
    simple but presentable\n\nIt's also a great way to get suggestions - they easily
    add a Space to dash after some feedback\n\r\nGrouses a little bit about how Kento
    seems resistant to implementing gamedev best practice, like version control and
    easy to understand naming systems \n\r\nMentions that Eren smoothed things over
    by saying they could have both the esoteric build name and the version number,
    but Kento insisted with the fancy names for the wiki\n\nSeems like Kento is naming
    the builds after the greek Charities?\n\r\nCreated the GitHub for the project
    (HitGlub) and gave both Eren and Kento contributor perms\r"
