  mailContent: 'Dear Rose, Eren and Kento,


    I''m deeply worried about your team.
    You have not only failed to upload the final deliverable to Game Hub and have
    consistently missed the last couple weeks of class, but also have password protected
    your devlog website and set the previous builds of your game to private (except
    the first one, for some reason...).


    While there is still time before the
    semester closes, I need at least one of you to reach out to me and send a build
    of the game so that I can give you feedback before the final showcase. If you
    do not, I will have no choice but to fail all of you.


    The door to my office
    is always open.


    Jason '
