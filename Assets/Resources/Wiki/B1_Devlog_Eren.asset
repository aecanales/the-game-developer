  Title: Mic Check, Magic, and Managing Kento
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "[SCRIPT]\r\nTesting. Hello? Cabbage dumplings. Rendezvous. \n\r\nOkay,
    good, my mic is working. If I had to return another one again I think I would
    have combusted. \n\r\nSo, uh, this is my first devlog for Trismegistus. That\u2019s
    what Kento\u2019s named it. He started work on it in his free time a few months
    ago and asked me to help on some code stuff, but we\u2019ve decided to make it
    our thesis project alongside Rose, who\u2019s both our, uh, good friend. \n\r\nIt\u2019s
    only been a few weeks, but I\u2019ve already made good progress. I set up a small
    test level that demonstrates the basic movement, camera and dialogue system.
    I\u2019ve also started working on the modular magic system she suggested, but
    that\u2019s gonna take a while. Kento wanted some way for us to add comments
    directly to build so I added that too. I had to use it immediately too after
    Kento added a seemingly random wall in the middle of the test level.\n\r\nI\u2019m
    a little worried about how Kento is reacting to bringing Rose on, though. I know
    this is a big step for him, but he already seems a little offput by the amount
    of initiative Rose is taking. Which I think is great, but he might not be willing
    to give up primary control of what is still functionally one of his babies. \n\r\nTo
    be honest, I\u2019m just really hoping we won\u2019t all get overwhelmed with
    work now, but at the end I just really want to see Kento succeed with his vision
    for the game more than anything.\r\n"
