  Title: 'Showcase! '
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "As of just now, our final build for the spring semester and the <mark=#ffff00aa>showcase</mark>
    next week has been submitted. We\u2019re finally almost free. \n\r\nWell, not
    that we\u2019re being held at gunpoint to finish our game, but I am so done with
    being in school. \n\r\nAnyways, after Rose finished all the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark>
    and <mark=#ffff00aa>arena assets</mark> and Kento finished with his <mark=#ffff00aa>puzzles</mark>
    I was able to implement the new levels into Toonity. The current progression
    of our game is now <mark=#ffff00aa>Maze</mark> > <mark=#ffff00aa>Frontier</mark>
    > <mark=#ffff00aa>Arena</mark>, with Kento planning a third <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    for after we graduate. We\u2019re about 80% there and plan to be working on <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>
    for a few more months once we don\u2019t have to go to class anymore. \n\r\nI
    still can\u2019t figure out what the deal is with the weird visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>
    we\u2019ve been continuing to get. It seems to have spread to all three of our
    Toonity installations, and sometimes the game is entirely unplayable when we
    export builds. Kento managed to get a build that reliably doesn\u2019t do that,
    but this is going to be a huge problem that we need to iron out sooner rather
    than later. I think it has something to do with how textures are linked to their
    models in-engine? I\u2019ve sent the Toonity devs another email, because Clover
    and all our other professors are equally stumped. \n\r\nAll three of us had a
    big discussion about post-grad plans the other day as well, just to figure out
    what our schedules will be looking like over the <mark=#ffff00aa>summer</mark>.
    I just interviewed with a smaller indie studio called Subliminal for a lead programmer
    role. I think they\u2019ll offer me the position since they really liked how
    I handled some of the coding hurdles in <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>,
    so here\u2019s hoping. \n\r\nKento and Rose mostly seem to have moved past our
    big fight a few months ago, but honestly I\u2019m still a little worried about
    them coming to blows again, especially since once we go solo on this we won\u2019t
    have regular work time and advising meetings anymore. \r"
