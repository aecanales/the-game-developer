  Title: Rose's Devlog #2
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Lists out all the assets she\u2019s finished or made progress on for
    the midsemester deadline\r\nMaze assets done\r\nMinotaur prelim animations and
    model\r\nModular magic UI and placeholder icons\r\n\nPretty upset at Kento for
    asking so much of her for their first checkin (she didn\u2019t see it as a hard
    academic deadline, more of a progress thing)\r\n\nGrouses about how Kento doesn\u2019t
    really seem to respect her experience when she warns them about overwork and
    burnout\r\n\nCrunch is an industry thing, yes, but long term it\u2019s really
    not good for you\r\n\nReflects on how crunch has bit her in the ass in the past
    and how she really tries to avoid it at all costs\r\n\nRelieved that their advisor
    seems to be warning Kento away from focusing too much on detailed things for
    this semester and telling him to focus on the big picture\r\n"
