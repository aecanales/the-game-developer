  Title: Looking forward.

  Content: "\tThe puzzle designs and dialogue for all the levels we\u2019ve been
    working on are finished, faster than expected actually. I used the extra time
    to finally draft an ending to our tale: Our heroic <mark=#ffff00aa>sorcerer</mark>
    uncovers a terrible secret, a desperate healing spell gone wrong that transformed
    the third <mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark> - his dear friend - into the very necromancer
    that haunts the world with his creations. In the climatic finale, he must step
    forth with a heavy heart to destroy the evil he brought into the world and seek
    redemption in the flames of combat. Fitting that this build is called Crimson
    <mark=#ffff00aa>Phoenix</mark>. \r\n\n\tI struggled with the finer details of
    it all. Tragedy requires nuance. A tragic hero is one who rises above humankind
    before falling far below it. And the change must be shocking and stark for it
    to have maximum impact. Yet it must also avoid being contrived. The shocking
    yet inevitable fall from grace: something of a literary hat trick. I\u2019ve
    done my best with it. \n\r\n\tLooking back over the dialogue I\u2019ve written
    for the necromancer, I\u2019m struck by how similar his voice is to someone I
    was close to, years ago. I think it\u2019s best I leave it alone: if you manage
    to channel something raw and real into your story, don\u2019t second guess it.\r\n\r\n\tI\u2019ve
    moved on to the more mechanical aspects of the ending. The final area, the Sanctum
    (or <mark=#ffff00aa>Ritual</mark>? Not sure yet), is in the early drafts; I\u2019ll
    come back to it once the dust settles <mark=#ffff00aa>post-grad</mark>. My workflow
    is too chaotic to focus on it for now. Rose likes to make these constant tiny
    little pushes on KitHub which make it hard for me to get the whole picture: more
    than once I\u2019ve started work on what I\u2019ve been told is the latest build
    only to find I\u2019ve actually run into conflict with some micro-update she\u2019s
    made. It would be easier if she would just push her work in one wave, so that
    I could see the full scope of potential conflicts. I doubt she\u2019ll want to
    work nearly this much after we graduate, so I should have a more stable foundation
    to work from then.\r\n\r\n\tThere is one complication: I have a job prospect
    from Double Lariat Studios. I\u2019ve gotten as far as my second interview. I
    would be foolish to turn down an offer from them, but I intend to negotiate a
    delay to beginning my position so I can finish this game.\r\n"
