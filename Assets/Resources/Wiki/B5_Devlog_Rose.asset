  Content: "- look i\u2019m sorry i forgot to submit to the <mark=#ffff00aa>dgc</mark>
    showcase\r\n<indent=5%>- i swear i remembered the date down correctly but i mixed
    it up with the tax filing deadline for this year  \r\n- yeah it looks bad for
    me! i know! this is gonna really affect my chances of getting a good job! groveling
    at your feet isn\u2019t going to turn back time for fucks sake! are you really
    that bent on torpedoing my self esteem </indent>\r\n- but kento seems to have
    decided in his head that i hate him and his game and am just fucking out to get
    him like his mom did when he was 12 or something\r\n<indent=5%>- dude your 23rd
    birthday was last week you should know better than to lay the blame for your
    trauma on others\r\n- and you know what contributes to my memory problems? information
    overload. large amounts of meaningless deadlines and being endlessly pushy for
    more more more more more\r\n- i was dead set on giving him a piece of my mind
    right then and there but 1) i felt horrendous about myself already and 2) eren
    timed us BOTH out for something that was clearly his friends fault</indent>\r\n-
    ugh i cant finish this now ill come back tomorrow\n\r\nupdate 3/17:\r\n- i figured
    out why my assets were causing that visual <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    it was because toonity changed how their assets link into the engine\u2019s systems
    \r\n- still haven\u2019t fixed the originals bc i really had to get the assets
    i was already working on done \r\n- eren found a temp fix but we had to take
    a lot of stuff out of the midterm build bc that was where the flashing problem
    was \r\n- once this deadline has passed i\u2019m going to take a few days to
    restructure my assets </indent>\r\n- but i managed to finish the frontier assets
    on time without any all nighters. kento\u2019s precious <mark=#ffff00aa>sorcerer</mark>
    now has the next leg of his journey available to him in the black <mark=#ffff00aa>tortoise</mark>
    build\r\n- i can't be forgetting things again this time. i've told a couple of
    companies i\u2019ve been interviewing with about this game and if i show them
    something unpolished it\u2019s on me and the rest of the team\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i\u2019ll be damned if i let kento\u2019s childishness torpedo my job prospects
    </indent>\r\n- also kento you know i can read your devlogs right? if you\u2019re
    gonna bitch about me at least do it in your bestie eren\u2019s dms or some shit
    \r"
