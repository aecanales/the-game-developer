  Title: Scope struggles and save system
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- Okay so we got feedback on our midterm build but let me just talk about
    what I did for that first\r\n- Uh so there\u2019s Rose\u2019s <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark>
    magic system. It\u2019s like really jank but it works. It\u2019s there\r\n- You
    can kill the minotaur boss at the end of the maze by using the pull spell on
    him a bunch of times. \r\n- Again though it\u2019s like really janky because
    I showed it to a classmate and they kinda just spammed the spell button and ran
    around until the <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur</mark> went flying off the stage\r\n-
    The level leyour is also there. It\u2019s a little sparse right now but Rose\u2019s
    stuff wasn\u2019t done in time for the deadline since she didn\u2019t want to
    pull an allnighter \r\n- Makes sense since we\u2019re still early on but Kento
    was kinda upset about that\r\n- I also implemented a save and load system \r\n-
    Right now you can press [KEY] to save and quit\r\n- [OTHER KEY] loads your progress
    after you open it again and it remembers where you were in the world space of
    the game \r\n- Anyway it was a whole mess because we almost didn\u2019t catch
    this critical bug that Kento found while doing honestly I have no idea what in
    the build like a few hours before we were supposed to submit\r\n- Instead of
    pressing [KEY] he accidentally pressed [KEY THAT CRASHES THE GAME] instead and
    the entire thing crashed\r\n- I patched in a hotfix for the deadline but it took
    me an oolong fuelled 2am bender rubber ducking it that night to finally find
    the bug\r\n- It was a single equals instead of a double equals which just feels
    so bad man. I managed to get it all sorted out though\r\n- The faculty pretty
    much unanimously told us we were going way too big on <mark=#ffff00aa>scope</mark>
    but it\u2019s okay because we\u2019re still early on in development\r\n- After
    hearing more about Kento\u2019s grand plans for <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>
    I can definitely see where they\u2019re coming from but man Kento did NOT seem
    to take that feedback too well\r\n- He was civil about it and said he\u2019d
    think about it but I could tell he felt conflicted about scaling back our game.
    He was like a cat with its tail twitching \r\n- Our advisor Clover said that
    we can keep things simple for now and revisit this question of scale sometime
    next semester\r\n- I\u2019m glad to hear that because it means I can take a step
    back a little bit\r\n- Gives me more time to grind the new lifetime suit in Momo
    Magick and watch the like 5 Solaris vods I missed while working on the midterm
    build\r\n"
