  mailContent: "Hi Lisa,\r\n\r\nAs we prepare for the end-of-year reporting, I wanted
    to request additional server capacity for the data processing load in the next
    few weeks. The holiday season tends to spike transaction volume, and I\u2019d
    like to ensure we have enough capacity to handle any surges without risking delays.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if we can reallocate resources from any low-priority projects, or if
    there\u2019s a possibility to get temporary provisioning on cloud servers. Happy
    to discuss this further if you need more details.\r\n\r\nThanks,\nEren"
