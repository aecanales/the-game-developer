  Title: Crunch and Compromise
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "I\u2019ve hit a wall with some coding stuff, so I may as well get this
    devlog out of the way while I\u2019m trying to clear my head. \n\r\nWe ran into
    quite a few issues during <mark=#ffff00aa>playtesting</mark>. I expected some
    of them to pop up, but some of the others were kind of absurd. For example, people
    kept shooting the tutorial old man so I had to rename him to Adorable Dog. We
    found a weird bug where if you walked into a specific corner of the <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark>
    the entire game crashed. One poor guy at Playtest Tuesday managed to break Kento\u2019s
    Toonity installation so badly he had to reinstall the entire program. \n\r\nBut
    we should have the close to final <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark> implemented alongside
    the <mark=#ffff00aa>minotaur </mark>boss!  We did get some feedback that killing
    the minotaur with the pull spell was not that intuitive and I can see why: you
    need to hold shift and press 2 to activate the pull spell, press 2 (without shift)
    to switch to the beam shape, and then go to a separate platform to pull the minotaur
    off. \n\nBut once this is fixed we can move on to the rest of the game next semester,
    starting with the <mark=#ffff00aa>frontier</mark> level Kento has planned. I
    already expect he\u2019ll have a ton of things for me when we come back. \n\r\nI
    am a little worried about Kento and Rose though. They seem to have completely
    opposite philosophies when it comes to gamedev. Kento is a more grindset person,
    while Rose is really anti-burnout. Rose mentioned after our midterm that she
    crunched to finish one of her games and it didn\u2019t turn out well, called
    <mark=#ffff00aa>The Last Knight</mark>. I went and played it and I kind of see
    what she means, but it was still a really good game. \n\r\nWe did come to an
    understanding after talking with Clover though, so I really hope it doesn\u2019t
    spiral out of control in the future. \n\r\nI\u2019m glad we made lots of progress
    this semester! I was worried that Kento would be more hostile to the idea of
    one of his brainchildren getting shared with someone that he doesn\u2019t super
    trust yet but I\u2019m so relieved it\u2019s been working out. \r"
