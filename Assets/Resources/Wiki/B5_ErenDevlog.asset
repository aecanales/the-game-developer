  Content: "Eren still trying to be the bridge between Kento and Rose even though
    it\u2019s becoming very clear that this isn\u2019t going to be feasible long
    term. Mention of the long hours he pulled getting everything implemented, laments
    that he had to use placeholders since Rose didn\u2019t have everything done.
    Still unable to fix the bug mentioned in previous builds due to time constraints
