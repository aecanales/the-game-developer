  Content: "trismegistus is now officially my thesis project for this year. it feels
    kind of surreal, to be honest - i\u2019ve spent so long with my stories locked
    away in my head out of necessity, and now here i am working on it with eren and
    rose\n\r\ni know we only have so much time, and that ultimately this is still
    a student undertaking, but i have high hopes for this game. i want it to be a
    journey not only for the amnesiac main character, but the player, who is experiencing
    this for the first time alongside the mc\r\nbut i\u2019m getting off track. i
    should talk more about what i have planned\n\r\nthe basic plot i\u2019ve settled
    on is that a sorcerer wakes up in the maze he\u2019s been sealed in and attempts
    an escape, only to realize that his journey is far from over once he finally
    steps outside of it. he must visit the domains of two sages and receive their
    blessings before becoming strong enough to confront the shadows of his past made
    manifest by the very act that wiped all magic from the world. in essence, it\u2019s
    about waking up to a world that no longer remembers you. \n\r\nit took a little
    while for rose and our advisor clover to understand what i was talking about,
    but when it clicked for them they were instantly on board with the idea, which
    i\u2019m glad for \r\nin terms of the puzzle systems, i\u2019ve decided to base
    most of them off of the modular magic system that rose suggested. loath as i
    am to admit it, it\u2019s a cool idea with lots of potential that i hadn't thought
    of before and i look forward to expanding on it \r"
