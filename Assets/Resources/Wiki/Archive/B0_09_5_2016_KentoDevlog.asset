  Title: First Devlog - Kento
  Subtitle: Why does magic grace the world? Because I once looked up at the stars
    and dreamed it was real.
  Content: "I\u2019m thrilled to be working on this for Thesis. Initially Eren and
    I started it as a passion project, not really expecting anything to come of it,
    but now we have a whole year to work on it as much as we can. I\u2019m aiming
    to have this published eventually, so we have to take this seriously.\r\nWe had
    our first meeting with our advisor Clover earlier this week. They seemed to be
    on board with the idea and even gave us a few jumping-off points for us to consider.
    Their main concern, however, was the lack of visual design and art in both our
    combined skill sets. I didn\u2019t think it was that big of an issue, but they
    suggested we look for collaborators within our cohort of classmates. \r\nThat
    aside, I\u2019ll need to detail everything about my vision for the game if we\u2019re
    to bring someone else onboard. Eren gets what I mean all the time, but other
    people might not. It\u2019s crucially important that we\u2019re all in agreement
    about the project. \r\nCurrently, The Last Sorcerer is a game about a sorcerer
    who is, predictably, the last of their kind - magic has disappeared from the
    world due to the hubris of man and it is his duty to bring it back. I intend
    for it to be an experience with little to no guidance, so that the player is
    encouraged to experiment and explore. A type of sandbox, if you will. \r\nI\u2019ll
    be working on the puzzles and story for the game, and Eren will be handling the
    programming. I suppose our third collaborator will make all the visual assets.
    \r\nI\u2019ve also decided to set up a wiki for our development process. We can
    upload builds and devlogs to it, and I think Eren can set our group chat to autoupload
    conversations as well; it\u2019ll be good to have a record of all of this to
    look back onto if need be. Eren said we can use his private server to host it
    as well. \r"
