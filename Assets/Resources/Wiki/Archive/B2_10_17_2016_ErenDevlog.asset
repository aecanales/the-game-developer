  Title: Eren's Devlog #2
  Subtitle: "Mid-semester deadline next week! \u0669(\u25D5\u203F\u25D5\uFF61)\u06F6"
  Content: "I\u2019ve been implementing everything that Kento and Rose have been
    coming up with into our latest build of the maze level (which we are calling
    <i>Asterion</i>), as well as programming all the intricacies of the player\u2019s
    movement (dashing, dodging, etc) and it\u2019s shaping up to be a really cool
    experience so far. (\u272F\u25E1\u272F) Kento\u2019s transformed Rose\u2019s
    modular magic concept into a whole intricate system, and after grumbling about
    it to me for a good lil\u2019 bit, I think he\u2019s come around and grown to
    really like it.\r\nBuuut, that does bring me to programming the boss\u2019s attacks. 
    I could program it just fine with the placeholder asset we\u2019ve been using,
    but I won\u2019t know the timings of the animations Rose is using on the actual
    sprite until she\u2019s finished with them, and I would likely have to redo all
    my programming work. We talked about that during our last meeting, but that caused
    Kento and Rose to get into a big <i>argument</i> (which I still feel really bad
    about). (U \u2022\u0301 .\u032B \u2022\u0300 U)\r\nIt really won\u2019t take
    me that long to implement all the assets once Rose is finished with them, but
    I\u2019m a little worried about Kento\u2019s pushiness. I don\u2019t really mind
    it since I\u2019m usually happy to help him out, but Rose isn\u2019t used to
    the way Kento works, and neither of them seem willing to change how they do things\u2026
    I hope it doesn\u2019t blow up into a full-fledged fight. \r\n\r\n<i>Addendum
    10/19:</i> I happened to overhear one of Kento\u2019s conversations with our
    advisor, who was worried that we\u2019re overscoping for the mid-semester deadline.
    Our advisor thought we\u2019re doing too much, especially with the art, but Kento
    reassured him that Rose was doing alright. It\u2019s a little unlike Kento to
    be so in-touch with Rose\u2019s workflow, especially since they\u2019ve been
    fighting,  but I guess they talked about it outside the meeting because Rose
    has been slowly working away at the necessary assets in the meantime. \r\nI\u2019m
    just glad everything turned out okay. ( \u02D9\u25BF\u02D9 )\r"
