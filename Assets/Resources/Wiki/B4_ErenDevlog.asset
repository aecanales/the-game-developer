  Content: 'Eren starts to show signs of burnout because (like Rose) he is still
    chipping away at the giant pile of stuff Kento wants him to implement. Ran into
    major bug and needed time to focus on it without adding anything new but Kento
    kept pushing for him to set it aside and get new things implemented (bug was
    hastily fixed and still crops up) '
