  Content: "Kento comes in after deadline and is very upset about how Rose seems
    to be \u201Ctaking over the project\u201D in his eyes\r\n\nEren is quick to try
    and defuse and says he was the one who suggested talking to their advisor, he
    can\u2019t blame Rose for that\n\r\nRose is like bro I don\u2019t want us to
    burn ourselves out on this trying to make the game of the year\n\r\nKento takes
    this as her still not being serious about the project (why cant it be goty?)\n\r\nRose
    is like c'mon man be realistic\n\r\nEren again tries to defuse the situation
    and say that surely all of them are committed to working towards completion,
    it\u2019s just that we need to be more conscious of what we can reasonably take
    on\n\r\nHe suggests that they all take a step back from working on it for a few
    weeks, since it\u2019s winter break soon anyway \r\n"
