    Subtitle: (working team name)
    Content: " \rRose A: Rose is a two-time Ingenious Developer Festival award nominee
      in the Student Game category, and her work has been covered by GameBros, Trapezoid,
      and other media outlets. Last year, she interned with Feldspar Studios as a
      concept artist.\r\n\r\nEren M: I am very excited to be working on this project!
      I used to work on websites but doing games sounds like is a lot more fun. Excited
      to see what Kento comes up with and so appreciative for Rose's guidance and
      expertise! :)) (R: Needs to be more abaout you. Also needs to be in the 3rd
      person)\r\n\r\nKento I: Developer, dreamer, brother, son, artist, philosopher,
      gamer, friend, writer, revolutionary, creator of worlds. Can one's identity
      truly be captured in just a few nouns in a biography? There is so much more
      to me than that---and I aim to bring it all into The Last Sorcerer."

    Title: The Last Sorcerer
    Subtitle: Game Pitch
    Content: 'The Last Sorcerer (E: why not a wizard?) is a story about resdiscovering
      magic in a world once ruled by powerful spellcasters. As you uncover the history
      of the golden age of magic, nefarious secrets come to light. Will you use these
      ancient and mysterious powers for the good of the world? (K: What do you think?)
      (R: I think we should include what kind of game it is. Like, its an adventure
      game)'

    Title: Kento's Dev Log
    Subtitle: Making sacrifices...
    Content: 'I''ve temporarily relented on my intent to have there be no spoken
      dialogue, and have the story communicated entirely through gesture and hieroglyphs.
      Eren and I tested a simple dialogue system with this "Old Man" character. Moving
      onto the <b>Asterion</b> build, I decided I wanted the player to start inside
      the maze. We''ll later learn this is the place they were imprisoned, which
      begs the question: WHY were they imprisoned?'

    Title: Soltrice
    Subtitle: Lore
    Content: 'The great giant, whose eyes are the three suns of Nyxos (the planet
      on which the game takes place). His third eye is called Kaos, and governs all
      forces of discord; desire, insurrection, and magic. A thousand years before
      the story began, the Paladins of the White Sea blinded the eye of Kaos in an
      effort to defeat Dirac, defeating the dark lord at the cost of wounding Soltrice
      - and the world - in turn. There can be no magic without chaos. (R: We should
      include this somehow in the Astereion build)'

    Title: Asterion Build
    Subtitle: Preliminary Level Design
    Content: 'K: Asterion, perhaps more commonly known as the Minotaur. The ferocious
      beast that guarded the labyrinth of Crete in Greek myth. Technically, a labyrinth
      differes from a maze in that a labyrinth has but a single path to the center.
      In a maze, however, there are "dead ends." This creates a parallel to our adventure
      game; the harbingers of the genre are labyrinths: there is one right answer,
      one path forward: "defeat the boss and move on," "you can''t progress past
      this area," "there are still things to do in this part of the map"... the player
      is not truly "adventuring." These modern games keep telling players where to
      go and what to do all the time. On the other hand, The Last Wizard is a maze.
      The player can tread off the beaten trail. It may be a "dead end," or it may
      not. The consequence of going right when you should have gone left is getting
      lost... and what fun is an advenutre if you can''t get lost in it?

      

      E:
      In this build, I included the labyrinth as Kento requested. (K: It''s a maze)
      It wasn''t too difficult to code, but I did stay up really late getting it
      done. In addition, we have some enemies that chase around the player. We''ve
      started talking about what kind of art style we''d like to go with. Rose''s
      ideas look really cool, and I don''t know exactly how we''re going to get all
      of the pixel art working the way she wants, but I know that some helpful stranger
      on YouTube must have the answers. '

    Title: Rose's Journal
    Subtitle: About the maze build...
    Content: I don't think the professor will be thrilled to have their feedback
      immortalized by Kento's little joke NPC. Inside jokes are fine, but did that
      little jab have to go into the PUBLIC facing build? I respect Kento's talent,
      but sometimes I question his maturity.
