  mailContent: "Hi Carlos,\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the logs and tracing the inputs,
    it looks like the discrepancy stems from the scheduled batch job running 30 minutes
    earlier than expected last Thursday. This caused the daily data import to overlap
    with a maintenance script we were testing in the sandbox environment, which might
    have led to the out-of-sync figures. I\u2019ll confirm once I can reproduce this
    in the staging environment.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a more detailed
    breakdown or screenshots of the logs. I\u2019ll keep you posted as I dig further.\r\n\r\nBest,\nEren"
