  Content: "Magic exists through religion, and religion exists through magic. It\u2019s
    a positive feedback loop. \n\r\nWhile Nostralia and Reyalita have been around
    since time immemorial, Immuta is a rather recent addition to the pantheon. \n\r\nA
    sorcerer of common birth, his incredible talent and skill with magic quickly
    caught the eye of many influential individuals. However, he never used his powers
    for personal gain - instead of taking up a position in the royal court like many
    thought he would, he decided to devote himself solely to the sages and become
    a traveling sorcerer, helping out anyone in need that he came across. \n\r\nEventually,
    his exploits caught the ear of the two sages themselves, and they rewarded his
    devotion by ascending him to godhood, making him the third sage of their pantheon.
    \n\r\nDevout followers of the sages are usually magic users, as worship of them
    is the main method of cultivating magical ability. Anyone in it purely for their
    own benefit will not see much improvement, if at all - only selflessly using
    one\u2019s magic for the betterment of others will grant further magical abilities.
