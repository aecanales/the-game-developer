  Title: Rose's Devlog #6
  Subtitle: 
  Content: Rose clearly upset that Kento is overloading both her and Eren with work
    while he goes off to his sandbox and churns out more stuff for them to do. Said
    she managed to finish most of the midgame assets but that Kento was very, very
    upset with her for not magically having everything done for the showcase. Likens
    him to an old bad boss she had during an internship
