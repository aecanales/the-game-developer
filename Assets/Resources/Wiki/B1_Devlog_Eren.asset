  Title: Eren's Devlog #1
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Tests out his new mic and is relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to return
    it for the third time\r\n\nTalks about how their thesis project was something
    him and Kento were working on for a little bit before bringing it into Thesis\r\n\nMention
    of how Kento is normally very possessive of his own projects and that he\u2019s
    glad Kento feels comfortable enough to bring others onto this particular one\r\n\nBig
    milestones he managed to hit in the past few weeks\r\n\tBasic features such as
    movement, camera, and enemy AI\r\r\n\tStarted work on modular magic system\r\n\tHe
    also added \"dev notes\" so people can leave comments in a level itself\r\n\nObservations
    of his teammates\r\n\tKento seems offput by the amount of initiative Rose is
    taking, but plans to reassure him that this is pretty much standard when working
    with others \r\n\tWorried that Kento will be unwilling to give up primary control
    of the aspects that Rose is working on\r\n\nPerhaps he won\u2019t get so overwhelmed
    with work now\u2026 Rose, with her gamedev experience, can act as a buffer to
    Kento\u2019s overzealousness and help them bring his vision to new heights\r\n\nAdmits
    at the end that he really just wants to see Kento succeed in his vision for the
    game more than anything\r"
