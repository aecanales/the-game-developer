  Title: Eren's Devlog #5
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Ran into major visual bug\r\n\tLots of artifacting and flashing that
    makes the game very hard to play if not unplayable\r\n\tNot sure what causes
    it - doesn\u2019t happen on every computer or build, and only on certain assets\r\n\nTalks
    about how Kento kept pushing for him to set it aside and get new things for the
    arena implemented for midterm check \r\n\tInsinuated that it was an issue with
    the assets Rose made and she should redo them\r\n\nBug was hastily fixed (he
    set a certain parameter to 0 on all affected items) and will likely come back
    at some point\r\n\nMentions how tired he is and that he randomly starts to get
    headaches when the lights are too bright\r\n\tPushes through because he really
    wants their project to be a success. Partially for Kento, and partially because
    this is now kind of his baby as well \r\n"
