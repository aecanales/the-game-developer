  Title: Eren's Devlog #1
  Subtitle: "We\u2019ve added Rose to our team! (\u2312\u25BD\u2312)\u2606"
  Content: "\rRose willl be handling all of the art and other visual design stuff
    like the UI. Like I said in my last log, her prior experience with gamedev will
    also help us out tremendously - me and Kento are still pretty new to this, after
    all. I\u2019m hoping to pick her brain on the programming and implementation
    side of things; she might not be programming for this game, but she\u2019s done
    some really neat stuff in the past. ( \u02D9\u25BF\u02D9 )\r\nOne big thing Rose
    brought up at our last meeting was that Kento\u2019s (still currently theoretical)
    system for magic would probably benefit from being modularized into two parts.
    Is modularized a word? I don\u2019t know. (\u201E\u2022 \u058A \u2022\u201E)
    Anyways. \r\nIt took some convincing to get Kento to give it a shot, but I think
    he\u2019s coming around. He gets\u2026 very stuck in his own ways sometimes (classic
    Kento!). After all, I wasn\u2019t able to get his previous ideas working in-engine
    to a point where he was happy with it. \r\nRose\u2019s modular system idea will
    definitely be a lot more straightforward to implement, and I actually already
    have a good chunk of it done already. It\u2019s still all placeholder sprites
    and there are a few bugs for me to iron out, but the spell combination system
    works and I\u2019m able to trigger different effects on the enemies based on
    the component parts of said spells. +\uFF61\uFF9F\u03C6(\u309D\u03C9\u30FB\uFF40\u25CB)+\uFF61\uFF9F\r\n\rAll
    in all, we\u2019re on a pretty good track, I think. At least with more of a distributed
    <i>workload</i> we won\u2019t all get overwhelmed with work now\u2026 \r"
