  mailContent: "Hi Eren,\r\n\r\nJust a reminder that our code freeze for the tax
    season\u2019s end-of-year update is in effect next Monday. Please have all final
    patches related to tax return processing, standard deduction adjustments, and
    1099 data uploads submitted for review by then. Anything involving core filing
    calculations or tax document generation needs to be flagged for additional testing
    (yes, again).\r\n\r\nOnce we\u2019re through this, we\u2019ll be shifting focus
    to the 2024 tax updates. As always, thanks for your patience with these yearly
    cycle tasks\u2014almost there.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nLisa"
