  Subtitle: "Can\u2019t wait to finally get to work on this in class! (\u2312\u25BD\u2312)\u2606"
  Content: "I really didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get this far on The Last Sorcerer,
    honestly. Kento and me started it for fun and now it\u2019s like a whole long-term
    project! Funny how these things work, sometimes.\r\nOur advisor did suggest we
    look into getting someone with more visual experience onto the project. To Kento\u2019s
    chagrin. Idk tho, I think it\u2019s a great idea. There\u2019s no guarantee that
    we\u2019ll have the funds or connections to commission an artist willing to endure
    Kento\u2019s vision, and developing visuals alongside the rest of the project
    is probably a much better use of our time anyway. \r\nMaybe Rose would be down
    to join us? (\xB4\uFF61\u2022 \u03C9 \u2022\uFF61`)\r\nShe did show a lot of
    interest during our initial presentation last week. She\u2019s also got quite
    a few games under her belt already, and that experience will be invaluable since
    we want to have this published eventually. I\u2019ll run it by her next week
    and see what she thinks. (\xB4 \u2200 ` *)\r\nWe also have a new wiki to track
    our progress in! (\u272F\u25E1\u272F)\r\nI\u2019m posting this devlog directly
    there, and I\u2019ll upload our progress builds and chat logs as well. I had
    to clear some stuff off my private server for the partition, but it was all random
    old stuff anyway.. \r\nThat aside, now I have to clean up the file structure
    of the project since I probably won\u2019t be the only person working on the
    code\u2026 \xAF\\_| \u2716 \u301C \u2716 |_/\xAF\r"
