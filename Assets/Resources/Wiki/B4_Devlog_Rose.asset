  Content: "- why the fuck did kento get mad at me for taking a break during break???\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i saw updates to the kithub pretty much every week and once again kento is just
    throwing work at me without discussing or even telling me about it\r\n- and then
    he got mad at me when i brought it up. like dude if we don\u2019t communicate
    this project is going to fall apart</indent> \r\n- speaking of break, i wanted
    to try out a new 3D modeling technique that i didn\u2019t get the chance to during
    the semester\r\n<indent=5%>- mostly bc i didn\u2019t want to break eren\u2019s
    systems but i also wasn\u2019t sure that it could apply to our game specifically
    \r\n- i revived the last knight to try it out on and it turned out super well
    so i ended up putting it on my website\u2019s games page\r\n- but now i know
    that the technique doesn\u2019t require us to redo all our implementation stuff
    so i can start using it going forward! </indent>\r\n- work updates: \r\n<indent=5%>-
    my initial plan last month was to do all the frontier assets and then tackle
    the arena stuff but kento is really pushing for me to do the arena ones so he
    can test his puzzles\r\n- i guess i can have a few of them do double duty but
    it\u2019ll be tough\r\n- something\u2019s gotta come off of my plate at some
    point. i\u2019ll bring it up at our next meeting because i do not want to crunch
    for this game</indent>\r\n- we\u2019re planning to submit to the indie showcase
    at dgc this year! \r\n<indent=5%>- i\u2019m really worried about the amount of
    polish we\u2019re gonna get on this before then\r\n- it needs to be presentable
    enough for industry professionals not to write it off but kento seems insistent
    on spreading us thin so he can go play in the sandbox he\u2019s asking us to
    make for him\r\n- if this ends up reflecting badly on us it\u2019ll be 100% his
    fault\r\n- i just hope we\u2019ll be ready in time\u2026 faunos vods save me
    </indent>\r\n"
