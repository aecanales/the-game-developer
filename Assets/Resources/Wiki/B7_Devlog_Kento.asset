  Title: Ongoing Struggles
  Subtitle: Kento
  Content: "\tA thousand words of story documentation and three puzzle design iterations
    per day on what I\u2019m now calling the <mark=#ffff00aa>Ritual</mark> level,
    minimum. I\u2019m burning my candle on both ends with all this <mark=#ffff00aa>writing</mark>
    and my teammates seem barely invested. I guess they\u2019ve already gotten their
    grade, huh?\n\r\n\tI tried to impress how important keeping up a timely pace
    for the assets is for Rose, and she outright told me that she\u2019d rather pawn
    it off onto some yahoo I find on the internet. Is she not aware of the fact that
    letting her work on <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark> was a huge privilege?
    Not to mention that their artstyle would absolutely clash with hers. \n\r\n\tI
    haven\u2019t gotten into any of the companies I\u2019ve interviewed for, so <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>
    is my only concern at the moment. The sparse feedback I\u2019ve received suggests
    that I struggle when I <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark>, and that\u2019s why
    I haven\u2019t received any offers. I\u2019ve gotten the \u201Csoft skills\u201D
    lecture from faculty before - apparently I tend to be very blunt when it comes
    to giving or receiving feedback, and most people don\u2019t like being told where
    they need to improve. I just think they need thicker skin, especially in this
    sort of creative industry. \n\r\n\tI\u2019m wary of any culture that prioritizes
    popularity over competence anyway. When most people say \u201Csoft skills\u201D
    they really mean \u201Care you willing to put up with nonsense management bullshit
    until you quit or get fired\u201D. That shit is lethal and I want no part in
    it. \n\r\n\tI\u2019ve long since accepted the eventuality that I\u2019ll need
    to finish the game without Rose. I wasn\u2019t really prepared to finish it without
    Eren, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder if we still share the same vision. The
    whole affair has put me in kind of a dark place, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s
    going to start coming through in my writing.\n\r\n\tAnyways, I compiled a new
    build with what little Eren and Rose have finished. I\u2019m reserving the Golden
    Dragon title for the final product, so this one is codenamed <mark=#ffff00aa>Jade</mark>.
