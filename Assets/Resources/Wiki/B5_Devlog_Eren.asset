  Title: 'Visual bug '
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- Dear diary, there\u2019s a huge <mark=#ffff00aa>bug</mark> that\u2019s
    destroying our game\r\n- It\u2019s a bunch of flashing lights and weird artifacting
    and makes the game pretty much unplayable\r\n- The most frustrating part is that
    it\u2019s only on certain computers so trying to diagnose this thing has been
    a real headache. I think it might have something to do with the new Toonity engine
    update? \r\n- Rose wanted to spend a few days getting to the bottom of things
    but Kento was really concerned about getting the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark>
    level done in time for the midterm build since he has the <mark=#ffff00aa>sage</mark>
    fights done already\r\n- Which is understandable but his agitated state really
    was just stressing me out even more\r\n- I ended up just setting a few parameters
    on the skybox to zero which turned them off entirely and stopped the flashing\r\n-
    I\u2019ll have to actually deal with it properly later ugh\r\n- I\u2019m also
    starting to have headaches again which could be the stress or the lack of sleep\r\n-
    It\u2019s probably the result of spending too much time in the coworking space
    between classes working on the game\r\n- The lights in that area are super bright,
    so I try to avoid it usually but I\u2019ve really been pushing myself lately
    because I want this game to be a success\r\n- I was just interested in helping
    Kento realize his vision at first but now that I\u2019ve spent so much time with
    the game it\u2019s sort of my baby as well\r\n- Still not as baby as Mooncake
    though\r\n- (DCIM_28374.png)\r\n- I\u2019m excited to finally get this in front
    of some real players hehe \r\n- I should check in with Rose about that\r\n"
