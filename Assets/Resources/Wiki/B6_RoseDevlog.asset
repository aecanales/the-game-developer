  Subtitle: 
  Content: "Rose getting very fed up with what she sees as Kento hounding her to
    spend all her free time on TLS. The nagging doesn\u2019t help because she needs
    space to cook, and after a few times of telling him to stops she ends up leaving
    him on read (which prompts more nagging)"
