  Title: Willing Sacrifices
  Subtitle: Kento
  Content: "\tWe're at the halfway point in the school year and the game is deceptively
    playable. By which I mean it's technically functional without being meaningful.
    Rose seems satisfied enough but I disagree, and I suspect Eren does as well.
    They will, of course, never voice that disagreement aloud.\r\n\r\n\tI sometimes
    wonder if Rose values comfort over productivity. <mark=#ffff00aa>Crunch</mark>
    was broached during our last talk. The discourse around that term is useless
    to anyone actually trying to break into the game scene. This is a cutting edge
    medium in a cutthroat industry; <mark=#ffff00aa>crunch</mark> happens because
    a team willing to do it will always have the edge over a team who isn't. It's
    a simple calculus: you get more done if you put in more time.\r\n\r\n\tThere's
    no doubt it's unhealthy, but idealistic pundits and young developers seem to
    have no plan for actually changing the industry enough to get rid of it. We will
    be in no position to oppose <mark=#ffff00aa>crunch</mark> if we don't have a
    successful game, if we don't have a seat at the table. There's no questioning
    Rose's talent, but it's as if she's only looking to produce a proof of concept
    to impress a professor and nothing more. That's not good enough. Right now, we're
    their job. Once we're out of school, we aren't their problem anymore. Are they
    going to finance our next game?\r\n\r\n\tNobody browsing Vapor is going to recommend
    some half-finished 'proof of concept.' Every week we spend 'resting' or working
    on other things is another feature that doesn't get finished, another player
    who puts our game down.\r\n\r\n\tI think it's vital at this stage that we make
    serious progress on the <mark=#ffff00aa>arena</mark> section. It's been a greybox
    for too long, and we won't even know if it works experientially until it's more
    complete. We still have big questions to answer as far as aesthetics (lighting,
    color palette, etc. - DETAILS MATTER), game feel, mechanical balance and so on.
    I have a whole other set of obstacles I've designed but have had no opportunity
    to test, and I won\u2019t get the chance until Eren implements placeholder assets.
    At least Rose had the foresight to make her assets easily modifiable. \r\n\r\n\tEven
    though we\u2019re planning to show this at the <mark=#ffff00aa>DGC</mark> conference
    in March (which will get our game in front of an audience that knows it\u2019s
    still a work in progress), I feel like I'm the only person on this team who understands
    that success in this industry is an uphill battle. \r\n\r\nThis is the career
    they both chose. Didn't they think it might require some sacrifice?\r"
