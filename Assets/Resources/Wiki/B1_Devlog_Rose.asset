  Title: 'magic '
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- excited to be working on trismegistus with eren and kento!! \r\n<indent=5%>-
    eren does witchcraft with his code that not even i understand</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    kento\u2019s made really interesting narrative/puzzle stuff in the past and i
    can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019s got planned for <mark=#ffff00aa>trismegistus</mark></indent>\r\n-
    modular magic system was actually an idea i\u2019d been chewing on for a while
    but i didn\u2019t really have the design knowledge to do it myself\r\n<indent=5%>-
    the whole a + b = c thing has to consider pretty much every combination</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    coding for that is way beyond what little i know lmfao</indent>\n<indent=5%>-
    I did add a space to dash to make it easier to move the character around</indent>\r\n-
    when i finally figured out what kento was trying to tell me about the narrative
    it just kinda clicked yknow\r\n- anyways i\u2019ve started working on <mark=#ffff00aa>assets</mark>
    to start building better looking levels, mostly to make it presentable before
    we can take it to playtest tuesdays\r\n<indent=5%>- kento was kinda hesitant
    to show it off so early but we need to know if the modmagic is working as intended</indent>\r\n-
    speaking of kento i\u2019m pretty sure this guy is allergic to gamedev best practices\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i made a kithub for the game bc apparently eren has just been storing this on
    his personal server???</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>- also kento keeps naming his builds
    esoteric things.  like based on the greek charities </indent>\n<indent=5%>- i
    keep telling him they need actual version numbers but it seems like they're only
    on the downloaded builds</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>- both of em have contributor
    perms now (though idk if they\u2019ll use em)</indent>\r\n"
