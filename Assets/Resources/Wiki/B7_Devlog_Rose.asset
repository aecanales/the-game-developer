  Content: "- look kento i know you read these so i\u2019ll repeat my point from
    last week: i cannot keep working at the pace you expect of me\r\n<indent=5%>-
    i have a full time job\r\n- i have social obligations\r\n- i need to go outside
    every once in a while\r\n- i have other things i want to be spending my time
    on\r\n- i am in a timezone 3 hours ahead of you </indent>\r\n- i cannot be constantly
    staring at 3d modeling softwares and art programs in my off time when i already
    do that from 9-5 5 days a week\r\n- on top of that you need to be telling me
    upfront what you need for your ritual level and fucking STICK TO IT\r\n<indent=5%>-
    if you say you don\u2019t need the giant worm enemy anymore and i\u2019ve already
    made the model for it that\u2019s your own fault for not communicating </indent>\r\n-
    not to mention we still have that weird flashing lights thing hanging over our
    heads that we NEED to fix before it becomes too big to ignore\r\n- want all this
    work done right now or you\u2019ll explode? like i said, hire another artist.
    i am not the only person in the world you can or should be asking for assets
    \r\n- anyways here\u2019s what i\u2019ve been able to chip away at despite the
    lady doth protesting too much\r\n<indent=5%>- some modified arena textures for
    the ritual level (corrupted, crumbling, you know the drill)\r\n- unrigged necromancer
    base model </indent>\r\n- i\u2019ve also picked up a few new techniques from
    my coworkers that have really helped with my workflow (did you know you can just
    hit select all in Mixer and it'll remember that selection when you go into the
    texture menu? i sure fucking didn\u2019t)\r\n- also i miss mooncake. my current
    lease doesn\u2019t allow pets so i can\u2019t even adopt a cat of my own \r\n<indent=5%>-
    the landlord is on the fence about it though. ther eis hope</indent>"
