  Title: midterm conquered
  Subtitle: 
  Content: "- midterm check is finally past whew\r\n- list of assets i've done (standard
    format): \r\n<indent=5%>- maze (environmental assets mostly, some tweaks)</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>-
    minotaur (model)</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>- modular magic ui and placeholder icons</indent>\r\n-
    i fuckin pulled an all nighter by mistake while working on the minotaur model
    \r\n<indent=5%>- cmon rose you made so much progress on Not Doing That what happened
    girl</indent>\r\n- when i told the others kento seemed like he wanted to encourage
    that behavior though which worries me\r\n<indent=5%>- crunch is an industry thing
    yeah but it\u2019s not good for you long term</indent>\r\n<indent=5%>- i should
    probably tell them about the last knight and how i crunched like hell on that
    only to release something half baked</indent>\r\n- our advisor clover seems to
    be warning the others away from crunch though which is good\r\n<indent=5%>- from
    what i understand she wants us to focus on broad strokes for now and fill in
    the details next semester</indent> \r\n<indent=5%>- she also told kento that
    his planned scope was too big for the time we have so hopefully that also helps
    reduce that stress</indent>\r\n- i really do wanna make sure that none of us
    crunch on this to the point where our health suffers\r\n"
