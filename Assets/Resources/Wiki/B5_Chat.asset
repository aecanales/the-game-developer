  Content: "Sisyphus Moment: rose you really just \u201Cforgot\u201D to submit for
    dgc? and we only find out when we talk to clover during our advising meeting?\r\nSisyphus
    Moment: don\u2019t think i don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to\r\ntoonity
    update anti: kento i promise i didnt do it on purpose i genuinely forgot\r\ntoonity
    update anti: you guys know my memory is really bad\r\ntoonity update anti: i
    mixed it up with the tax filing deadline for this year bc the numbers are reversed\r\ntoonity
    update anti: 13th and 31st\r\nSisyphus Moment: after all you\u2019ve been saying
    about not wanting to put my hard work in the game? and you expect me to believe
    you didn\u2019t do it on purpose?\r\nSisyphus Moment: for god\u2019s sake don\u2019t
    you at least WRITE THINGS DOWN\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Kento, being overly
    accusatory isn\u2019t gonna help us with anything, please stop.\r\ntoonity update
    anti: if writing things down worked for me i would have fucking done it by now!
    \r\nSisyphus Moment: well then what am i supposed to be doing then? \r\nSisyphus
    Moment: just letting the biggest opportunity we\u2019ve ever had to get our game
    out there slide? \r\nSisyphus Moment: don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re on her side
    now\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: I\u2019m not taking sides, I just want us to
    be objective about this. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: The 13th and 31st are very
    similar dates, and I can see how Rose would have mixed them up if they both had
    important deadlines tied to them. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Besides, raking
    her over the coals is only going to make things worse. We\u2019re still a team,
    and we can work this out without fighting. \r\ntoonity update anti: ugh fine
    \r\ntoonity update anti: kento i can promise you this won\u2019t happen again
    \r\nSisyphus Moment: that\u2019s what my parents would always say to me every
    time they forgot something that was important to me\r\nSisyphus Moment: every
    single birthday, every single milestone or award. \r\nSisyphus Moment: they didn\u2019t
    even bother coming to my high school graduation because they \u201Cforgot\u201D
    my brother\u2019s 6th grade award ceremony was on the same day. \r\nSisyphus
    Moment: every time they would say the same thing\r\nSisyphus Moment: \u201Coh
    i\u2019m so sorry i forgot. this won\u2019t happen again\u201D\r\nSisyphus Moment:
    it always did.\r\nSisyphus Moment: so why should i believe you? \r\ntoonity update
    anti: kento i am NOT your parents why the fuck are you comparing me to them?
    \r\ntoonity update anti: i had nothing to do with your emo boy villain origin
    story leave me out of it \r\nSisyphus Moment: and yet you\u2019ve done the same
    thing they\u2019ve always done\r\nSisyphus Moment: why should i believe you?
    \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Hey, stop that. That\u2019s not fair to Kento and
    you know it.\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Kento, you lay off of Rose too. Shaming
    her for forgetting an optional deadline isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere.
    \r\nSisyphus Moment: eren don\u2019t pretend you aren\u2019t disappointed in
    rose as well\r\nSisyphus Moment: clearly no one\u2019s ever told her that her
    little mistakes have consequences, so i will \r\ntoonity update anti: you think
    you\u2019re the only one out there who acts like forgetting things and murder
    are on the same level? \r\ntoonity update anti: you think i wasn\u2019t constantly
    told as a child that something i genuinely struggled with was only happening
    bc i was just lazy and didn\u2019t want to do things and just needed to apply
    myself more? \r\nSisyphus Moment: ugh give me a BREAK\r\nSisyphus Moment: people
    like you are always the same. hiding behind forgetfulness as an excuse \r\ntoonity
    update anti: you shut your fucking mouth right now. \r\ntoonity update anti:
    dont you DARE tell me that something that\u2019s been plaguing me all my life
    is a silly little excuse i use to get out of doing things \r\nFlashing Lights
    Warning: Both of you, that\u2019s ENOUGH. \r\ntoonity update anti: kento dont
    be running your mouth any longer i know where you li\r\n[rosygoldart has been
    placed in timeout by erenlaiii.]\r\n[KentoWrites has been placed in timeout by
    erenlaiii.]\r\nFlashing Lights Warning: Both of you are going to stop talking
    in here, calm down, and sleep this off. \r\nFlashing Lights Warning: We\u2019ll
    address this properly tomorrow. \r"
